well then how about a ruler,3
sir this is not a lending library its the hall of records,3
can i check one of these volumes out,3
if thats what it says,3
but that means that most of the valleys been sold in the last few months,3
thats right,3
then these are all new owners,3
land sales out of escrow are always recorded within the week,3
how come all these new names are pasted into the plat book,3
row twentythree section c,3
ill settle for la county,3
who do you blame for that her,3
the future mr gittes the future now wheres the girl i want the only daughter i have left as you found out evelyn was lost to me a long time ago,3
then why are you doing it how much better can you eat what can you buy that you cant already afford,3
oh my yes,3
i want to know what youre worth over ten million,3
i have no idea how much do you want,3
how much are you worth,3
just incorporate the valley into the city so the water goes to la after all its very simple,3
how do you do that,3
thats all taken care of you see mr gittes either you bring the water to la or you bring la to the water,3
theres going to be some irate citizens when they find out theyre paying for water theyre not getting,3
no mr gittes thats what i am doing with the valley the bond issue passes tuesday therell be ten million to build an aqueduct and reservoir im doing it,3
and thats what you were going to do in the valley,3
thats where life begins marshes sloughs tidepools he was fascinated by them you know when we first came out here he figured that if you dumped water onto desert sand it would percolate down into the bedrock and stay there instead of evaporating the way it does in most reservoirs youd lose only twenty percent instead of seventy or eighty he made this city,3
havent the faintest idea,3
hollie was always fond of tidepools you know what he used to say about them,3
the coroners report showed mulwray had salt water in his lungs,3
that you killed hollis mulwray,3
what does this mean,3
yes i think i can manage,3
an obituary column can you read in this light,3
what is it,3
id like you to look at something mr cross,3
with her mother,3
where is she,3
shes fine,3
is she all right,3
ive got her,3
well you dont look any the worse for wear mr gittes i must say wheres the girl,3
well be in touch mr cross,3
avocado groves,3
ill look into it as soon as i check out some avocado groves,3
just find the girl,3
okay my secretaryll send you a letter of agreement tell me are you worried about that girl or what evelyn might do to her,3
ive still got a few teeth in my head mr gittes and a few friends in town,3
how did you find out,3
well shes an extremely jealous person i didnt want her to find out about the girl,3
if you want to hire me i still have to know what you and mulwray were arguing about,3
hollis mulwray made this city and he made me a fortune we were a lot closer than evelyn realized,3
i didnt realize you and hollis were so fond of each other,3
just find the girl mr gittes i think she is frightened and i happen to know hollis was fond of her id like to help her if i can,3
what about her,3
my daughter,3
ive got the photographs in my office if theyll help you remember what was the argument about,3
well it was about five days ago you were outside the pig n whistle and you had one hell of an argument,3
at my age you tend to lose track,3
yeah do you remember the last time you talked to mulwray,3
sheriffs gold posse bunch of damn fools who pay 5000 apiece to the sheriffs reelection i let em practice up out here,3
when was the last time,3
no,3
you didnt see mulwray much did you,3
if mulwray was murdered she was probably one of the last people to see him,3
maybe,3
wouldnt it be useful to talk to her,3
no shes probably scared to death,3
doesnt that strike you as odd,3
yeah,3
yes shes disappeared hasnt she,3
you mean the little chippie he was with at the el macando,3
yes his girlfriend,3
his girlfriend,3
course im respectable im old politicians ugly buildings and whores all get respectable if they last long enough ill double whatever your fees are and ill pay you ten thousand dollars if you can find hollis girlfriend,3
mainly that youre rich and too respectable to want your name in the papers,3
exactly what do you know about me mr gittes,3
was he right,3
its what the da used to tell me about chinatown,3
why is that funny,3
you may think you know what youre dealing with but believe me you dont,3
what for,3

for talking him into building it he never forgave my father they havent spoken to this day,3
never forgave him for what,3
yes he never forgave him for it,3
oh yeah,3
not exactly well i mean yes yes and no hollis felt the public should own the water but i dont think my father felt that way actually it was over the van der lip the dam that broke,3
then it was over the water department,3
not over me why would they have a falling out over me,3
over the water department or over you,3
no yes a little you see hollis and my fa my father had a falling out,3
is there something upsetting about my asking about your father,3
oh,3

yes of course it was quite a while after i was just out of grade school when they did that,3

how did it happen,3
i dont believe you,3
no not for that one,3
you seem to have had a reason for every other question,3
no im just a snoop,3
you mustve had a reason to ask me that,3
no reason,3
yes why,3
that your maiden name,3
k cross,3
i dont see anyone for very long mr gittes its difficult for me now i think you know all you need to about me i didnt want publicity i didnt want to go into any of this then or now is this all,3
for very long,3
you were seeing someone too,3
i mean i cant tell you,3
you mean you dont know where you were,3
i cant tell you,3
where you were when your husband died,3
is there anything else you want to know,3
well i wouldnt run home and tell him whenever i went to bed with someone if thats what you mean,3
did he know,3
mr gittes,3
did you have affairs,3
i dont like the word cheat,3
shes cheating on him,3
unless what,3
look i do matrimonial work its my metiay when a wife tells me shes happy her husband is cheating on her it runs contrary to my experience,3
why,3
youll have to explain that mrs mulwray,3
i was grateful,3
and you werent the slightest bit upset about it,3
he told you,3
my husband,3
how did you find out,3
well i suppose i am actually i knew about the affair,3
but he wasnt killed,3
if your husband was killed it was this can look like you paid me off to withhold evidence,3
it wasnt much of a lie,3
sorry look you sue me your husband dies you drop the lawsuit like a hot potato and all of it quicker than wind from a ducks ass excuse me then you ask me to lie to the police,3
mr gittes dont tell me how i feel,3
i think so something besides your husbands death was bothering you you were upset but not that upset,3
i have,3
stop it the moneys fine its generous but youve shortchanged me on the story,3
well how much would you like,3
mrs mulwray im afraid thats not good enough,3
yes as i said i was very grateful,3
i got your check in the mall,3
a check,3

look at it this way now this phony broad excuse the language says shes you shes hired me whoever put her up to it didnt have anything against me they were out to get your husband now if i see him i can help him did you talk this morning,3
its very personal it couldnt be more personal is this a business or an obsession with you,3
nothing personal mrs mulwray i just,3

well that little girlfriend she was attractive in a cheap sort of way of course shes disappeared maybe they disappeared together somewhere,3
you may if you can mr gittes,3

what do you mean,3
you see somebody went to a lot of trouble here and i want to find out lawsuit or no lawsuit im not the one whos supposed to be caught with my pants down so id like to see your husband unless thats a problem,3
well ive been accused of many things mrs mulwray but never that,3

oh yeah it was a big thing at the time julian cross daughter god almighty she was a wild little thing,3
she ran away,3
no hes only got one i remember her age i read it in the newspapers when she ran away,3
you must be thinking of a different daughter,3
she must be about thirtythree thirty four,3
she aint exactly long in the tooth now,3
that right she used to be some looker,3
im working for his daughter,3
is the pope catholic who are you mister i ask because he doesnt see a whole lot of people,3
im going to see a man called julian cross ever heard of him,3
lots of fellas do tell the little woman theyre going on a fishing trip then shack up with some little twist on the island she pretty,3
but thats what you told your wife,3
not exactly,3
whatever you do love it like you loved that projection booth of the paradiso when you were little,3
thanks for all youve done for me,3
no toto nobody said it i say it lifes not like you saw it in the movies lifeis harder get out go back to rome you re young the world is yours and im oldi dont want to hear you talk any more i want to hear talk about you,3
who said that gary cooper james stewart henry fonda huh,3
do like the soldier toto go away this land is cursed when youre here every day you feel like youre at the center of the universe it seems like nothing ever changes then you go away one year twoand when you come back everythings different the thread has broken you dont find those you were looking for your things no longer exist isnt that the caseyouve got to go away a long time for many many years before coming back and finding your people again the land where you were bornbut not now its impossible now youre blinder than i am,3
now i understand why the soldier went away just before the end thats right just one more night and the princess would have been his but she also could not have kept her promise andthat would have been terrible he would have died from it so instead for ninetynine nights at least he had lived with the illusion that she was there waiting for him,3
listen to this onethe commander says to the sergeant you remember that windmill that used to be there yes sir i remember the mills gone but the winds still there you remember the story of the soldier and the princess,3
it was probably meant to be like this each of us has a star to follow so now what are you thinking of doing,3
no and nobody knows where she is,3
did you ever see her again,3
toto sooner or later there comes a time when talking or keeping quiet is the same thing so its better to shut up its hot in here toto take me to the beach,3
they tell me you never go out never talk to anybody why,3
you re thinneryou can tell youve not been treated well,3
no nobody came,3
im here take it easy take it easy sit down sit down did she come,3
but whered you go toto,3
you were expecting her huh its a nasty business waiting by yourself in company its better nothen ill leave,3
no alfredo i was coming to help you,3
you werent expecting me,3
could bebut i dont like this business it smells fishy to me,3
just so alfredo there isnt any and if you buy a television set you can watch it at home without any fuss,3
toto are you pulling my leg or something how is it possible to see this television without film,3
no you mean right at the end alfredo thats right toto right at the end and dont ask me what it means if you figure it out let me know,3
i want to make you happy toto im going to tell you a story once upon a time a king gave a feast and there were all the most beautiful princesses of the realm basta one of the guards saw the kings daughter she was the loveliest of all and he immediately fell in love with her but what could a poor soldier do compared with a kings daughterone day he managed to meet her and told her he couldnt live without her the princess was so struck by the depth of his feeling that she said to the soldier if you will wait a hundred days and a hundred nights beneath my balcony then in the end ill be yours christ the soldier ran off there and waited one day two days ten twentyevery night she looked out of her window but he never budged come rain wind snow never budged the birds shat on him and the bees ate him alive after ninety nights he was gaunt and pale and tears streamed from his eyes but he couldnt hold them back he didnt even have the strength to sleep any more the princess kept watchand on the ninetyninth night the soldier got up picked up his chair and left,3
you see it s like i say you always have an answer for everything,3
heeey totooooo dont get pissed off with me now come here i dont know where the fuck i have to go and the next time be careful how you talk not to take credit away from the lord but if i had created the world in all modesty certain things would have come out better but unfortunately such was not the case,3
stop it ive had enough of your sermons you act as if you created the world,3
dont think about it toto dont even try with feelings theres nothing to understand,3
but why there must be some way to make her understand,3
i told you the blueeyed ones are the most difficult,3
theyre not my words john wayne said it in shepherd of the hills,3
what you say is wonderful but sad,3
eh lovewhat a mystery i understand you totothe ones with blue eyes are the most beautiful whatever you do you cant make friends with them eh theres nothing to be done about it the heavier a man is the deeper his footprints and if hes in love he suffers because he knows hes up a oneway street because love is a meaningless thing when a man gets it into his head to do what he wants,3
whats she like whats she like,3
yes its a girl i saw at the station,3
is there a womantell me the truth there is a woman,3
nothing theres nothing its all out of focus,3
now what can you see,3
its people in the slaughterhouse killing a calf theres blood all over the floor like a lake and through this lake another calf passes by on its way to die,3
what is it what is it whats the picture,3
yes,3
ive shown it so many times i know it by heart the first time i showed it in 1940 was the sunday my first wife died they kept it hidden from me all day so they wouldnt have to close down the movie house i only found out that night after the last show those are things you never forget so toto how are these home movies going,3
thats right modern times,3
chaplins modern times right toto,3
progress it always arrives too late,3
whatd i tell you it doesnt catch fire,3
for example at this moment the films out of focus go see,3
yes i want proof,3
toto this isnt for you for the moment the cinema paradiso needs you and you need the cinema paradiso but it wont lastsome day youll have other things to do more important things thats right more important i know it now that ive lost my sight i see more i see everything i didnt see before and its all thanks to you who saved my life and ill never forget it and dont put on that look i havent gone off my head yet you want proof,3
why what do you mean,3
dont do thatsooner or later youll be left emptyhanded,3
ok ok but now that ive got a job i11 probably stop going,3
hows school,3
come in alfredo,3
any room for me in this cinema paradiso,3
too bad,3
its got to be sent to another town and if we dont the owner of that movie house gets pissed off,3
peppinoooo come back sooon good thing germanys closer than russia,3
who knowsits like an adventure hope springs eternal,3
will they really find work in germany,3
it tastes wonderful,3
you understand which side the gelatins on,3
alfredo go fuck yourself,3
with timeyou get used to it besides when you hear from up here that theres a full house and that people are laughing having fun then youre happy too so ive been wasting my breath you pretend to agree with me but as soon as my back is turned you do what you want get out of here i dont want to lay eyes on you again this is the last straw your mothers right youre crazy but howd he do it the little bastard by watching hes learned its incredible im letting the box office know youre not to set foot even into the theatre there are no more tickets for you and im also talking to father adelfio you wont be an altar boy any more either you little runt,3
but dont you like anything about what you do,3
good for you toto good for you im only saying this for your own good cooped up in here you die of heat in the summer and of cold in the winter you breathe in smoke gas fumes and earn practically nothing,3
no,3
because im an idiot how many other guys in town know how to be a projectionist none only a jerk like me could do it besides i wasnt lucky when i was a kid there was the war when i grew up another war now its all different times have changed and you want to be a dope like me huh answer me,3
then why dont you change jobs,3
because i dont want to toto this is not a job for you its like being a slave youre always alone you see the same film over and over again because you have nothing else to do and you start talking to greta garbo and tyrone power like a nut you work on holidays on christmas on easter only on good friday are you free but if they hadnt put jesus christ on a crossyoud work good fridays too,3
then why dont you want to teach it to me too now that theres no more cranking and its easier,3
now listen to what ive got to say i took up this profession when i was ten years old in those days there werent these modern machines the films were silent the projectors were run by hand like this with a crank and you wound the crank all day long it was really rough going if you got tired and slowed down boom everything would go up in flames,3
toto come here,3
i told my mother you werent the one who gave me the films that it wasnt your fault but i thought you said the film could catch fire just to scare me now that i know i wont steal any more from you thats all i wanted to say im going,3
all right all right when ive got kids thats what im telling them,3
but you dont have any kids,3
i choose my friends for their looks and my enemies for their brains youre too smart to be my friend besides as i always tell my kids be careful to pick the right friends,3
of course i knew your father he was tall thin pleasant and had a moustache like mine always smiling he looked like clark gable,3
alfredo did you know my father,3
what you find tonight on the floor between the seats,3
fifty lire,3
signora maria dont do that hes just a kid and why are you telling fibs we let him in free he must have lost the money inside the movie theatre how much did you have,3
i bought a ticket ive come to see the film,3
what are you doing here,3
look toto before i kick your ass all the way to china and back lets make a deal these strips here are yours i give them to you however one youre not to stick your nose in here any more two ill keep them for you because you cant take them home for god forbid and save our souls if they catch fire all hell will break loose ok oh and now scram,3
so i can have these,3
cause sometimes you cant find the right place any more and sowell actuallythey stay here besides there are more kisses than you can count,3
and turn into a piece of charcoal,3
you must not come here how many times do i have to tell you if the film catches fire runt that you are youd go up in a burst of flamewhoosh and turn into a piece of,3
and the next time dont go around saying such heresy you survived the fire at the movie house but no one can save you from the fire of hell,3
oh yes father now everythings clear,3
you understand now you see it clearly,3
i know but take themiracle of the loaves and fishes for example i think about it a lothow is it possible for,3
but alfredo what youre saying is horrifying,3
father adelfio i have a very serious doubt that is torturing my soul and youve got to help me because ive lost all peace of mind,3
what is it alfredo right now of all times,3
yeahgetting theres downhill and all the saints help you but coming back the saints stand there watching you thats all gods will be done,3
good morning father its hard on the feet huh,3
ill never agree with you never elena,3
no salvatorethere is no future theres only the past even meeting last night was nothing but a dream a beautiful dream we never did it when we were kids remember now that its happened i dont think there could have been a better ending,3
what difference does it make to find an explanation thats the way it went but alfredo didnt betray you he was the only one who really understood you salvatore if you had chosen to be with me youd have never made your films and that would have been a pity because theyre wonderful ive seen them all but you shouldnt have gone and changed your name you should have kept your own,3
but i never saw that note i must have covered it with my hand without realizing it thats the only explanation,3
he wasnt crazy in the beginning i was upset i think i really hated him but then with time i understood what he saidand your silence too,3
oh how i looked for you elena youll never know i wrote telephoned nothing nobody ever answered but i dreamt of you for years thats why i went awayand never came back here even as the years passed in all the women i met i was only looking for you i had success its true but there was always something missing id never have imagined that all this had to end because of the man who was like a father to me a crazy lunatic,3
i told him id take his advice but before i went away i left you that note i was on my way down the stairs,3
alfredo damn him he cast his spell on you too,3
its the first time ive had to chance to tell the story i never mentioned it to anybody,3
nor have i even though you disappeared but whats the point of talking about it we risk being pathetic and ridiculous you still live in rome,3
but ive never forgotten you elena,3
politics hes the district representative we met at the university in pisa,3
sure sure boccia whats he do,3
my husbandyou know him,3
all things considered yes even if it wasnt what i dreamt of then,3

you never used to do that,3
and i never asked for one you have nothing to explain i always thought that what you did was right and that was that with no beating around the bush only one thing made me suffer bolting the door shut before going to bed at night,3
noits nothing to do with you its just that i was scared of coming back now after all these years i thought i was strong that i had forgotten lots of things instead i find its quite the opposite as if i had never left and yet i look at lia and feel as if i didnt know her and you mammai abandoned you ran away like a thief thought only of myself and never gave you an explanation,3
you shouldnt tell me that now after all these years i put all your things in here go in go in,3
no mamma it only takes an hour by air you know,3
see how pretty the house is we did everything over if it hadnt been for you come i have a surprise you must be tired if you want to rest theres time before the funeral,3

what the fuck you talking about you getting into the act too toto titanus has trouble giving me even one copy and i have to say thanks if i ask for two the least theyll do is cut off my head and play ball with it,3
the projectors all rusty but i could fix it in two or three days give the place a good cleaning put in some seats and bring in a projectionist and well show catene in two houses,3
so whats that got to do with it,3
don ciccio ive got an ideayou remember that old abandoned movie house where theyre supposed to build those lowrent houses,3

i know,3
you know how long it took the chronicle to get that staff together twenty years,3

look at that,3
from the chronicle building that sign is the biggest thing you can see every floor guaranteed lets hope it bothers them it cost us enough,3
lets hope they like it there,3
thesell be kept ill provide the people of this city with a daily paper that will tell all the news honestly i will also provide them,3
you dont wanta make any promises mr kane you dont wanta keep,3

i cant take shorthand mr kane,3
my declaration of principles dont smile brad take dictation mr bernstein,3
oh,3

mr leland if mr kane he should decide to drop the price to one cent or maybe even he should make up his mind to give the paper away with a halfpound of tea youll just hold him until i get back wont you,3
ready for dinner brad,3
all right but ill keep these figures too just in case,3
refigure it mr bernstein at two cents,3

the food is marvelous in cuba the senoritas are beautiful stop i could send you prose poems of palm trees and sunrises and tropical colors blending in far off landscapes but dont feel right in spending your money for this stop theres no war in cuba regards wheeler,3
thats all right we have no secrets from our readers mr thatcher is one of our most devoted readers mr bernstein he knows whats wrong with every issue since ive taken charge whats the cable,3
how are you mr thatcher,3
mr bernstein mr thatcher,3
well well isnt that nice,3
yes very naturally,3
enthusiastic,3
oh yes its already made up our mr mervin wrote a small review,3
and the social how about the music notice you got that in,3
yes i thought it was a good idea weve covered it from the news end of course,3
thats a long story,3
hes a great guy leland whyd he ever leave new york,3
thats right they called us the three musketeers,3
you and leland and mr kane you were great friends back in the old days i understand,3
i might make him nervous,3
well why dont you mr bernstein you know mr leland,3
go in and ask him to hurry,3
just old age its the only disease mr thompson you dont look forward to being cured of you ought to see mr leland theres a whole lot of things he could tell you if he wanted to,3
nothing particular the matter with him they tell me just,3
you dont say why i had no idea,3
in case youd like to know mr bernstein hes at the huntington memorial hospital on 180th street,3
maybe that was something he lost mr kane was a man that lost almost everything he had you ought to talk to bradford leland he could tell you a lot i wish i could tell you where leland is but i dont know myself he may be out of town somewhere he may be dead,3
yes,3
it ended then there was susie that ended too i guess he didnt make her very happy you know i was thinking that rosebud youre trying to find out about,3
it didnt end very well did it,3
the way things turned out i dont need to tell you miss emily norton was no rosebud,3
oh yes he saw to that i tell you mr thompson he was a hard man to figure out he had that funny sense of humor and then too maybe he thought by finishing that piece he could show leland he was an honest man you see leland didnt think so i guess he showed him all right hes a nice fellow but hes a dreamer they were always together in those early days when we just started the enquirer,3
well then how could he write that roast the notices in the kane papers were always very kind to her,3
he thought she was great mr thompson he really believed that he put all his ambition on that girl after she came along he never really cared for himself like he used to oh i dont blame susie,3
i guess mr kane didnt think so well of susies art anyway,3
he finished it he wrote the worst notice i ever read about the girl he loved we ran it in every paper,3
its not trick to make an awful lot of money if all you want is to make a lot of money thatcher,3
he made an awful lot of money,3
thatcher that man was the biggest darn fool i ever met,3
nobody else but ive been through that stuff of walter thatchers that journal of his,3
who else did you see,3
im going back there,3
sure sure,3
you know why she was so,3
susie i called her myself the day after he died i thought maybe somebody ought to she couldnt even come to the phone,3
well i went down to atlantic city,3
who else you been to see,3
im calling on people who knew mr kane im calling on you,3
youre pretty young mr mr thompson a fellow will remember things you wouldnt think hed remember you take me one day back in 1896 i was crossing over to jersey on a ferry and as we pulled out there was another ferry pulling in and on it there was a girl waiting to get off a white dress she had on and she was carrying a white pastrol and i only saw her for one second and she didnt see me at all but ill bet a month hasnt gone by since that i havent thought of that girl see what i mean well so what are you doing about this rosebud mr thompson,3
not some girl he knew casually and then remembered after fifty years on his death bed,3
that rosebud maybe some girl there were a lot of them back in the early days and,3
we thought maybe if we can find out what he meant by that last word as he was dying,3
from before the beginning young fellow and now its after the end anything you want to know about him about the paper,3
well mr bernstein you were with mr kane from the very beginning,3
whos a busy man me im chairman of the board i got nothing but time what do you want to know,3
mr kane is finishing your piece the way you started it,3
i suppose hes fixing it up i know id never get that through,3
kane charlie where is he,3
mr kane is finishing it,3
where is it wheres my notice ive got to finish it,3
hello bernstein,3
hello mr leland,3
yes mr bernstein,3
not to me but you will let that cop go home with mr kane wont you,3
go and get yourself washed up mr bernstein there doesnt seem to be an serious injury,3
if you hadnt come along and protected me when you did id have killed them fellows,3
im all right mr leland only there was some fellows out front that thought they ought to take things up with me i learned em didnt i officer,3
whats happened,3
september the ninth,3
well hell be coming back in september the majestic i got the reservations it gets in on the ninth,3
,3
if you thought id answer different from what mr kane tells you well i wouldnt,3
yes,3
mr bernstein am i a stuffed shirt am i a horsefaced hypocrite am i a new england schoolmarm,3
dont i always most of the time,3
mr bernstein i wish youd let me ask you a few questions and answer me truthfully,3
i wanted him to have fun and with me along,3
mr leland why didnt you go to europe with him he wanted you to he said to me just yesterday,3
certainly not,3
do you mr leland,3
probably theres always a chance of course that theyll change mr kane without his knowing it,3
certainly not so whats that got to do with it mr kane hell have them changed to his kind of newspapermen in a week,3
do we stand for the same things that the chronicle stands for mr bernstein,3
sure theyre like anybody else they got work to do they do it only they happen to be the best men in the business,3
mr bernstein these men who are now with the enquirer who were with the chronicle until yesterday werent they just as devoted to the chronicle kind of paper as they are now to our kind of paper,3
whats the matter,3
yes,3
isnt it wonderful such a party,3
certainly not,3
do you mr leland,3
that looks pretty nice,3
sixtytwo thousand,3
you just made the paper over four times today mr kane thats all,3
charlie,3
wasted,3
its three hours and fifty minutes late but we did it,3
well be on the street soon charlie another ten minutes,3
who said anything about brooms,3
im not guaranteeing a thing mr bernstein you people work too fast for me talk about new brooms,3
but mr kane i meant,3
it is accepted mr carter with assurances of my deepest regard,3
ive been a newspaperman my whole life and i dont intend if its your intention that i should continue to be harassed by this this i warn you mr kane it would go against my grain to desert you when you need me so badly but i would feel obliged to ask that my resignation be accepted,3
thatll be all today mr carter youve been most understanding good day mr carter,3
but mr kane,3
really mr kane i cant see the function of a respectable newspaper,3
thats the kind of thing we are going to be interested in from now on mr carter right now i wish youd send your best man up to see mr silverstone have him tell mr silverstone if he doesnt produce his wife at once the enquirer will have him arrested have him tell mr silverstone hes a detective from the central office if mr silverstone asks to see his badge your man is to get indignant and call mr silverstone an anarchist loudly so that the neighbors can hear,3
its not our function to report the gossip of housewives if we were interested in that kind of thing mr kane we could fill the paper twice over daily,3
the chronicle doesnt say shes murdered mr carter it says the neighbors are getting suspicious,3
as a matter of fact we sent a man to the silverstone home yesterday afternoon our man even arrived before the chronicle reporter and theres no proof that the woman was murdered or even that shes dead,3
if the headline is big enough it makes the new big enough the murder of mrs harry silverstone,3
there is no news big enough,3
im still hungry brad lets go to rectors and get something decent the chronicle has a twocolumn headline mr carter why havent we,3
because were running a newspaper mr kane not a scandal sheet,3
im not criticizing mr carter but heres what i mean theres a front page story in the chronicle and a picture of a woman in brooklyn who is missing probably murdered a mrs harry silverstone why didnt the enquirer have that this morning,3
thats one of the things i think must be changed mr carter the news goes on for twentyfour hours a day,3
but a morning newspaper mr kane after all were practically closed twelve hours a day except for the business offices,3
im going to live right here as long as i have to,3
my little sanctum is at your disposal but i dont think i understand,3
youve got a private office here havent you,3
how do you do mr bernstein,3
mr carter this is mr bernstein mr bernstein is my general manager,3
i dont my plans myself,3
you may resume your work gentlemen i didnt know your plans and so i was unable to make any preparations,3
ask them to sit down,3
i thought it would be a nice gesture the new publisher,3
are they standing for me,3
how do you do mr leland,3
thank you mr carter this is mr leland,3
welcome mr kane to the enquirer i am herbert carter,3
he used to work fast didnt he mr bernstein,3
we havent heard from him,3
has he said when hell finish,3
yes mr kane,3
thats leland isnt it,3
no mr kane,3
it isnt finished,3
but theres another one still to come the dramatic notice,3
yes mr kane,3
is it good,3
yes mr kane,3
and the notice,3
exactly according to your instructions mr kane weve got two spreads of pictures,3
was the show covered by every department,3
weve got a nice plant here,3
mr kane this is a surprise,3
of course,3
not at all id like the nurse to be here too,3
there are no objections to my staying here with her are there,3
im sure thats it,3
thank you i cant imagine how mrs kane came to make such a silly mistake the sedative dr wagner gave her is in a somewhat larger bottle i suppose the strain of preparing for her trip has excited and confused her,3
the nurse has complete instructions but if you care to talk to me at any time i should be only too glad i shall be here in the morning,3
id rather mr kane withdrew without having to get the story published not that i care about him but id be better off that way and so would you mrs kane,3
you dont have to show me anything mr rogers i believe you,3
the story about him and miss alexander mrs kane,3
what story mr rogers,3
i think i understand mr rogers but i wonder if,3
im protecting myself every way i know how mrs kane this last week i finally found out how i can stop your husband from being elected if the people of this state learn what i found out this week he wouldnt have a chance to he couldnt be elected dog catcher well what im interested in is seeing that hes not elected i dont care whether they know what i know about him let him keep right on being the great noble moral champeen of the people just as long as,3
let him finish charles,3
charles your your breaking this mans neck would scarcely explain this note serious consequences for mr kane for myself and for my son what does this note mean miss,3
maybe you can do it and maybe you cant mr kane,3
i made miss miss alexander send you the note she was a little unwilling at first but she did it,3
how do you do i came here and i made mr kane come with me because i recieved this note,3
if youre asking me to sympathize with him brad youre wasting your time theres only one person im sorry for as a matter of fact that that shabby little girl im really sorry for her brad,3
hes paying for it emily those returns tonight hes finished politically socially everywhere i guess i dont know about the papers but,3
i know it is brad,3
its all over,3
brad im im not an old woman yet,3
emily you,3
maybe i should have the first time he showed me what a mad dog he really was,3
i know that emily,3
there arent any personal lives for people like us he made that very clear to me nine years ago if id thought of my life with charles as a personal life id have left him then,3
emily youre being a little unfair you know what i think of charles behavior about your personal lives,3
why should anyone vote for him hes made it quite clear to the people what he thinks of them children to be told one thing one day something else the next as the whim seizes him and theyre supposed to be grateful and love and adore him because he sees to it that they get cheap ice and only pay a nickel in the street cars,3
emily,3
im surprised he got the votes he did,3
almost two to one,3
chicago is pretty close to new york nowadays only twenty hours,3
im sorry i sent for you brad i didnt,3
emily,3
hello brad,3
too late for what too late for you and this this public thief to take the love of the people of this state away from me well you wont do it i tell you you wont do it,3
charles if you dont listen to reason it may be too late,3
go on get out i can fight this thing all alone,3
you decided what you were going to do charles some time ago you cant always have it your own way regardless of anything else that may have happened come on charles,3
theres only one person in the world to decide what im going to do and thats me and if you think if any of you think,3
no,3
i dont think so are you coming charles,3
oh yes there is,3
im not interested in the voters of this state right now i am interested in well junior for one thing,3
i suppose so but im not afraid of the story you cant tell me that the voters of this state,3
charles this this story doesnt concern only you ill be in it too wont i and junior,3
oh theyll publish it all right but thats not going to stop me,3
i dont see what else you can do charles if hes right and the papers publish this story he has,3
you dont think im going to let this blackmailer intimidate me do you,3
youre a cheap crooked grafter and your concern for your children and your mother,3
oh,3
im going to 185 west 74th street,3
i insist on being told exactly what you have in mind,3
i intend to find out,3
it may not be about anything at all,3
whats this all about emily ive had a very tiring day and,3
no it cant good night darling,3

yes,3
no youre not,3
im going to leave you,3
im not sorry,3

susan it seems to me,3
youll never have another chance to hit me again i never knew till this minute,3
love you dont love anybody me or anybody else you want to be loved thats all you want im charles foster kane whatever you want just name it and its yours only love me dont expect me to love you,3
youre talking an incredible amount of nonsense susan whatever i do i do because i love you,3
susan,3
well im not going to stop it im going to say exactly what i think youve never given me anything youve tried to buy me into giving you something youre its like you were bribing me thats what its been from the first moment i met you no matter how much it cost you your time your money thats what youve done with everybody youve ever known tried to bribe them,3
susan i want you to stop this and right now,3
oh i dont mean the things youve given me that dont mean anything to you whats the difference between giving me a bracelet or giving somebody else a hundred thousand dollars for a statue youre going to keep crated up and never look at its only money it doesnt mean anything youre not really giving anything that belongs to you that you care about,3
susan i really think,3
what you want me to want you mean what youve decided i ought to have what youd want if you were me but youve never given me anything that,3
as far as youre concerned susan ive never wanted anything i dont want anything now except what you want,3
ill discuss whats on my mind when i want to youre not going to keep on running my life the way you want it,3
we can discuss all this some other time susan right now,3
im not just your wife im a person all by myself or i ought to be i was once sometimes you get me to believing i never was,3
youre my wife susan and,3
oh im sick and tired of you telling me what i must and what i musnt do,3
ive got more than a right as far as youre concerned susan,3
im not going to have my guests insulted just because you think if people want to bring a drink or two along on a picnic thats their business youve got no right,3
youre in a tent darling youre not at home and i can hear you very well if you just talk in a normal tone of voice,3
i mean it oh i know i always say i mean it and then i dont or you get me so i dont do what i say im going to but,3
invite everybody order everybody you mean and make them sleep in tents who wants to sleep in tents when they have a nice room of their own with their own bath where they know where everything is,3
i was referring to myself i thought we might have a picnic tomorrow it might be a nice change after the wild west party tonight invite everybody to go to the everglades,3
its not a habit i do it because i like it,3
you may be right i sometimes wonder but you get into the habit,3
it makes a whole lot more sense than collecting venuses,3
cant we go back charlie,3
you always said you wanted to live in a palace,3
hurray for the bulldog half past eleven the shows have just let out people are going to night clubs and restaurants of course were different we live in a palace at the end of the world,3

rogers i dont think i will postpone doing something about you until im elected to start with ill break your neck,3
i cant tell you the things he said charlie you havent got any idea,3
dont you worry about me im charles foster kane im no cheap crooked politician trying to save himself from the consequences of his crimes,3
youre the greatest fool ive ever known kane if it was anybody else id say whats going to happen to you would be a lesson to you only youre going to need more than one lesson and youre going to get more than one lesson,3
i see,3
get out ive got nothing to talk to you about if you want to see me have the warden write me a letter,3
youre making a bigger fool of yourself than i thought you would mr kane youre licked why dont you,3
mrs kane im not asking you to believe me id like to show you,3
you do anything you want to do the people of this state can decide which one of us to trust if you want to know theyve already decided the election tuesdayll be only,3
im going to be elected governor and the first thing im going to do,3
anything you say mr kane only were talking now about what you are thats what the note is about mrs kane now im going to lay all my cards on the table im fighting for my life not just my political life my life if your husband is elected governor,3
im not a gentleman mrs kane and your husband is just trying to be funny calling me one i dont even know what a gentleman is you see my idea of a gentleman mrs kane well if i owned a newspaper and if i didnt like the way somebody else was doing things some politican say id fight them with everything i had only i wouldnt show him in a convict suit with stripes so his children could see the picture in the paper or his mother its pretty clear im not a gentleman,3
in case you dont know emily this this gentleman is,3
she doesnt know mrs kane she just sent it because i made her see it wouldnt be smart for her not to send it,3
youve made your point perfectly clear mr kane good day,3
im much obliged mr president for your concern about me however i happen to be concerned at this moment with the matter of extensive oil lands belonging to the people of the united states and i say that if this lease goes through the property of the people of the united states goes into the hands of,3
i understand that you have political ambitions unfortunately you seem incapable of allowing any other opinion but your own,3
thanks,3
i know the facts mr kane and i happen to have the incredible insolence to differ with you as to what they mean youre a man of great talents mr kane,3
its the only vein i know i tell the facts the way i see them and any man that knows that facts,3
i must refuse to allow you to continue in this vein mr kane,3
im not suggesting anything mr president ive come here to tell you that unless some action is taken promptly and you are the only one who can take it the oil that is the property of the people of this country will be turned over for a song to a gang of highpressure crooks,3
it is the unanimous opinion of my cabinent in which i concur that the proposed leases are in the best interests of the governement and the people you are not i hope suggesting that these interests are not indentical,3
you cant,3
mr kane how can i persuade you,3
if youre interested in what people say signor matisti i may be able to enlighten you a bit the newspapers for instance im an authority on what the papers will say signor matisti because i own eight of them between here and san francisco its all right dear signor matisti is going to listen to reason arent you maestro,3
but it is impossible i will be the laughingstock of the musical world people will say,3
your job isnt to give mrs kane your opinion of her talents youre supposed to train her voice nothing more,3
impossible impossible,3
youre right we did lose a million dollars last year,3
i happened to see your consolidated statement yesterday charles could i not suggest to you that it is unwise for you to continue this philanthropic enterprise this enquirer that is costing you one million dollars a year,3
on the other hand i am the publisher of the enquirer as such it is my duty ill let you in on a little secret it is also my pleasure to see to it that decent hardworking people of this city are not robbed blind by a group of money mad pirates because god help them they have no one to look after their interests ill let you in on another little secret mr thatcher i think im the man to do it you see i have money and property,3
charles my time is too valuable for me,3
as charles foster kane who has 			eighty two thousand six hundred and thirtyone shares of metropolitan transfer you see i do have a rough idea of my holdings i sympathize with you charles foster kane is a dangerous scoundrel his paper should be run out of town and a committee should be formed to boycott him you may if you can form such a committee put me down for a contribution of one thousand dollars,3
the trouble is mr thatcher you dont realize youre talking to two people,3
theyre all part of your general attack your senseless attack on everything and everybody whos got more than ten cents in his pocket theyre,3
mr thatcher isnt everything ive been saying in the enquirer about the traction trust absolutely true,3
wont you step into my office mr thatcher,3
i came to see you charles about your about the enquirers campaign against the metropolitan transfer company,3
i think well have to send our friend wheeler a cable mr bernstein of course well have to make it shorter than his because hes working on an expense account and were not let me see mike,3
you see there hasnt been a true word,3
can you prove it isnt,3
enemy armada off jersey coast you know you havent the slightest proof that this this armada is off the jersey coast,3
i dont know how to run a newspaper mr thatcher i just try everything i can think of,3
is that really your idea of how to run a newspaper,3
wherem i going,3
your mother wont be going right away charles,3
you goin mom,3
i didnt used to be afraid of it,3
no i dont mr kane,3

hello charlie i didnt know we were speaking,3
hello brad,3
i couldnt possibly live on as little as that charlie well let the salary stay where it is,3
well youve been getting a pretty low salary here in new york it seems to me that the new dramatic critic of our chicago paper should get what hes worth,3
yes,3
you still want to be transferred to the other paper,3
hey brad ive been analyzed an awful lot tonight lets have another brandy,3
i know you will,3
she can leave me as a matter of fact ive already left her dont worry brad ill live,3
its simpler than that brad a society girl cant stand the gaff thats all other things are important to her social position what theyre saying on the front porches at southampton is it going to be embarrassing to meet somebody or the other at dinner,3
you want love on your own terms dont you charlie love according to your own rules and if anything goes wrong and youre hurt then the game stops and youve got to be soothed and nursed no matter what else is happening and no matter who else is hurt,3
nothing if she dosent love me,3
thats all right what are you going to do about emily,3
youre not going to like it in chicago they wind comes howling in from the lake and theres practically no opera season at all and the lord only knows whether theyve ever heard of lobster newburg,3
yes now will you let me go to chicago,3
are you finished,3
you talk about the people of the united states as though they belonged to you when you find out they dont think they are youll lose interest you talk about giving them their rights as though you could make a present of liberty remember the working man you used to defend him quite a good deal well hes turning into something called organized labor and you dont like that at all and listen when your precious underprivileged really get together thats going to add up to something bigger than than your privilege and then i dont know what youll do sail away to a desert island probably and lord it over the monkeys,3
you almost convince me im just drunk enough to tell you the truth i have to be a little drunk for that because im a coward you know that thats why you keep me around you only associate with your inferiors charlie i guess thats why you ran away from emily because you cant stand the company of your equals you dont like to admit they exist the other big people in your world are dead i told you that,3
the personal note is all there is to it its all there ever is to it its all there every is to anything stupidity in our government complacency and selfsatisfaction and unwillingness to believe that anything done by a certain class of people can be wrong you cant fight those things impersonally theyre not impersonal crimes against people theyre being done by actual persons with actual names and positions and the right of the american people to own their own country is not an academic issue brad that you debate and then the judges retire to return a verdict and the winners give a dinner for the losers,3
theres no reason why this this savage personal note,3
you might have made the whole thing less personal,3
do you think the enquirer shouldnt have campaigned against the oil leases,3
she hasnt any friends left sine you started this oil business and she never sees you,3
why is she leaving me,3
sure i am she wants full custody of the child no matter what happens if you wont agree to that shell apply for a divorce regardless of the presidents wishes i cant tell her shes wrong because she isnt wrong,3
brad you are drunk,3
emilys going south next week with the child as far as anybodys to know its a holiday when they get back,3
she was going to leave you anyway,3
i dont think so brad weve just had word that the president is out of danger it seems i didnt kill him after all,3
shes going to leave you,3
all right,3
no that wont help besides you never get drunk i wanted to talk about you and emily,3
ill tell you what ill do brad ill get drunk too maybe thatll help,3
i want to be transferred to the new paper youve been saying yourself you wish you had somebody to thats not what i wanted to talk about,3
why brad,3
charlie its just no go we cant agree anymore i wish youd let me go to chicago,3
thats just a little promotion scheme nobody expects you mike will you try and get mr leland some coffee,3
first of all i will not write a good review of a play because somebody paid a thousand dollars for an advertisement in the enquirer,3
ill get you some coffee,3
im drunk,3
whats wrong brad,3
first of all,3
go ahead,3
id like to talk to you about that,3
ive got to think of emily,3
what,3
i dont have to i run a newspaper with half a million readers and theyre getting a martyred president this morning with their breakfast i cant help that besides they all know im married to his niece ive got to think of her,3
charlie now youre not making sense,3
what lesson not to expose fraud when i see it not to fight for the right of the people to own their own property run it the way i said reilly this afternoon a great man was assassinated,3
there are the people of the united states and they are blaming you oh i know it doesnt make any sense but at least you can learn a lesson from it,3
look out that window,3
oil belonging to the people of the united states was leased out for a song to a gang of highpressure crooks nobody can blame me because,3
charlie,3
theyre true everything i said witholding that veto was treason,3
youve said a lot of things about the president in the last few months,3
i said treason was a capital offense punishable by death,3
and that copy of the enquirer said the president should be killed,3
because the crackpot who did it had a copy of the enquirer in his pocket,3
yesterday morning you called the president a traitor what do you think that crowd is doing down there they think you murdered him,3
what do you mean by that,3
why not well nobodys a great man in your estimation until hes dead,3
why not,3
do you think youre the one who should call him a great man,3
yes,3
charlie,3
take dictation front page editorial this afternoon a great man was assassinated he was the president of the united states,3
youre wrong it does make a difference to you rectors brad come to think of it i dont blame you for not wanting to be a war correspondent you wont miss anything it isnt much of a war besides they tell me there isnt a decent restaurant on the whole island,3
it doesnt make any difference about me but one of these days youre going to find out that all this charm of yours wont be enough,3
yes,3
charlie,3
you start tomorrow night richard carl in the spring chicken ill get us some girls you get tickets a drama critic gets them free you know rectors at seven,3
id like that,3
you dont want to be a war correspondent how about being a dramatic critic,3
good,3
i mean ive got a job for you,3
yes,3
say brad ive got an idea,3
and i do it because they do it and they do it its a vicious circle isnt it im going over to georgies brad you know georgie dont you,3
they do it only because you do,3
how would the enquirer look with no news about this nonexistent war with benton pulitzer and heart devoting twenty columns a day to it,3
charles i tell you there is no war theres a condition that should be remedied but between that and a,3
all right brad all right you dont have to be a war correspondent unless you want to id want to hello georgie,3
but there is no front charlie theres a very doubtful civil war besides i dont want the job,3
itll be our first foreign war in fifty years brad well cover it the way the hickville gazette covers the church social the names of everybody there what they wore what they ate who won the prizes who gave the prizes i tell you brad i envy you by bradford leland the enquirers special correspondent at the front im almost tempted,3
our readers are anyway i dont know about the rest of the country,3
well gentlemen are we going to war,3
its a good idea for a newspaper four hundred sixy thousand,3
the chronicle is a good newspaper,3
people are going to know whos responsible and theyre going to get the news the true news quickly and simply and entertainingly and no special interests will be allowed to interfere with the truth of that news,3
thats the second sentence youve started with i,3
whatre you going to do charlie,3
ive changed the front page a little mr bernstein thats not enough theres something ive got to get into this paper besides pictures and print ive got to make the new york enquirer as important to new york as the gas in that light,3
a wasted day,3
its been a tough day,3
tired,3
what makes those fellows think that a newspaper is something rigid something inflexible that people are supposed to pay two cents for,3
poor mr carter,3
i think its beginning to dawn on mr rogers that i mean what i say with mr rogers out of the way reilly i think we may really begin to hope for a good government in this state well mr bernstein,3
rogers isnt even pretending he isnt just scared anymore hes sick frank norris told me last night he hasnt known rogers to be that worried in twentyfive years,3
it does seem too good to be true doesnt it mr bernstein,3
it was for twentyfive thousand dollars,3
oh yes the bonus,3
you made it out to him last week after he left for chicago,3
what check,3
mr leland sent back that check,3
well withdraw support completely anything else,3
what do you mean by that,3
maybe wed better wait for more word on the presidents condition,3
yes,3
thats what you think is it jim,3
sorry mr thatcher what the kid needs is a good thrashing,3
you wont be lonely charles,3
youre going to live with mr thatcher from now on charlie youre going to be rich your ma figures that is er she and i have decided that this isnt the place for you to grow up in youll probably be the richest man in america someday and you ought to,3
thats the train with all the lights,3
mr thatcher is going to take you on a trip with him tonight charles youll be leaving on number ten,3
it is go on mr thatcher,3
well lets hope its all for the best,3
if i want to i can go to court a father has a right to,3
its going to be done exactly the way ive told mr thatcher,3
you people seem to forget that im the boys father,3
ill sign those papers,3
hey nurse,3
sure mr leland ill be glad to,3
on your way out stop at a cigar store will you and send me up a couple of cigars,3
sure,3
i dont know he was disappointed in the world so he built one of his own an absolute monarchy it was something bigger than an opera house anyway nurse say ill tell you one thing you can do for me young fellow,3
that must have been love,3
i guess maybe im not as hard to see through as i think anyway i never even answered his letter maybe i should have i guess he was pretty lonely down there those last years he hadnt finished it when she left him he never finished it he never finished anything of course he built it for her,3
yes,3
well thats about all there is and im getting chills hey nurse five years ago he wrote from that place of his down south you know shangrila el dorado sloppy joes whats the name of that place you know all right xanadu i knew what it was all the time you caught on didnt you,3
he married for love thats why he did everything thats why he went into politics it seems we werent enough he wanted all the voters to love him too all he really wanted out of life was love thats charlies story its the story of how he lost it you see he just didnt have any to give he loved charlie kane of course very dearly and his mother i guess he always loved her as for emily well all i can tell you is emilys story as she told it to me which probably isnt fair theres supposed to be two sides to every story and i guess there are i guess theres more than two sides,3
was he in love,3
brief marriage ten years,3
i am in receipt of your favor of yesterday i beg you to do me the courtesy of accepting my assurance that mrs whitehall cannot be induced to contribute any more information on the career of charles foster kane she has authorized me to state on previous occasions that she regards their brief marriage as a distateful episode in her life that she prefers to forget with assurances of the highest esteem,3
he knows the first mrs kane socially thats the answer we got,3
oh yes i know about mr rawlston,3
rawlston is my boss,3
david grobleski davis my dear rawlston,3
its a letter from her lawyers,3
whats this,3
i can remember everything thats my curse young man its the greatest curse thats ever been inflicted on the human race memory i was his oldest friend as far as i was concerned he behaved like swine maybe i wasnt his friend if i wasnt he never had one maybe i was what nowadays you call a stooge,3
maybe you could remember something that,3
never mind bernstein told you about the first days at the office didnt he well charlie was a bad newspaper man even then he entertained his readers but he never told them the truth,3
sorry mr leland,3
you dont happen to have a cigar do you ive got a young physician must remember to ask to see his license the odds are a hundred to one he hasnt got one who thinks im going to stop smoking i changed the subject didnt i dear dear what a disagreeable old man ive become you want to know what i think of charlie kane well i suppose he has some private sort of greatness but he kept it to himself he never gave himself away he never gave anything away he just left you a tip he had a generous mind i dont suppose anybody ever had so many opinions that was because he had the power to express them and charlie lived on power and the excitement of using it but he didnt believe in anything except charlie kane he never had a conviction in his life i guess he died without one that must have been pretty unpleasant of course a lot of us check out with no special conviction about death but we do know what were leaving we believe in something youre absolutely sure you havent got a cigar,3
mr leland you were,3
how do you do charles,3
this is mr thatcher charles,3
charles my name is mr thatcher,3
right here mrs kane,3
where do i sign mr thatcher,3

i want you to stop all this nonsense jim,3
the banks decision in all matters concerning his education his place of residence and similar subjects will be final,3
i want you to stop all this nonsense jim,3

theres a part of a scotch castle over there but we havent bothered to unwrap it,3
yeah all in crates,3
good,3
ill get to it right away mr rawlston,3
nothing is ever better than finding out what makes people tick go after the people that knew kane well that manager of his the little guy bernstein those two wives all the people who knew him had worked for him who loved him who hated his guts i dont mean go through the city directory of course,3
but dont you think if we release it now hes only been dead four days it might be better than if,3

see what i mean he was a little gone in the head the last couple of years anyway but i knew how to handle him that rosebud that dont mean anything i heard him say it he just said rosebud and then he dropped that glass ball and it broke on the floor he didnt say anything about that so i knew he was dead he said all kind of things i couldnt make out but i knew how to take care of him,3
well thanks a lot,3

dont you think i do you say youre going down to xanadu,3
i feel kind of sorry for him all the same,3

you mean on a date,3
let me take you out tonight,3
i dont know maybe we should just see what happens,3
so what so we should just make pretend over the phone that were dating,3
the key word here is talk dante i think the idea the conception of us dating is more idyllic than what actually happens when we date,3
cute tell me you wouldnt want to go out again after all the talking weve been doing,3
you work in a market all right,3
give me a bit more credit i think its time we got back together you know im more mature youre more mature youre finishing college im already in the job market,3
its just the shock of seeing me after three years believe me youll get over it,3
i would like to be your boyfriend yes,3
youre serious you want to date again,3
we could introduce them they might hit it off,3
im sure sang andveronicawould like that,3
but can we date,3

so whos asking i dont want to marry you,3
i had to bring you down from that cloud you were floating on when i say i dont want to get married i mean just that i dont want to marry anybody not for years,3
jesus youre caustic,3
if im so nuts about you then why am i having sex with an asian design major,2
i just believe in giving credit where credit is due and i believe that im the impetus behind your failure to wed,3
look how full of yourself you are,3
you lie,3
you dont have anything to do with it,3
tell me i dont have something to do with it,3
why mr hickswhatever do you mean,3
theres more isnt there,3
i just told you,3
if hes so nice why arent you going to marry him,3
stop it hes a nice guy,3
sang his name is a past tense,3
i dont want to marry him i dont want to get married now im on the verge of graduation i want to go to grad school after this and then i want to start a career i dont want to be a wife first and then have to worry about when im going to fit in all of the other stuff ive come way too far and studied too hard to let my education go to waste as a housewife and i know thats what id become sangs already signed with a major firm and hes going to be pulling a huge salary which would give me no reason to work and hes so traditional anyway,3
what,3
im giving him his ring back,3
yeah but not seriously christ youre ready to walk down the aisle id say that constitutes something more than just seeing somebody,3
no i wasnt not really i told youd id been seeing other people,3
but you were,3
the last thing i needed was for you to think i was hiding something from you,3
and you came here to what to comfort me,3
i love a macho fa??ade its such a turnon what smells like shoe polish,3
wreck is a harsh term disturbed is more like it mildly disturbed even,3
was i right,3
thanks for the vote of confidence,3
then my mother called me this morning and told me the announcement was in the paper thats when i hopped the train to come back here because i knew youd be a wreck,3
how like her,3
the story goes like this he proposed and i told him i had to think about it and he insisted i wear the ring anyway then my mother told the paper we were engaged,3
no youre not really getting married,3
no,3
so youre really getting married,3
because i know you you prefer drastic measures to rational ones,3
how do you know that,3
i wouldve told you and you would have stopped calling like a baby,3
is that what they teach you at that school of yours kind of sort of everyone knows about this except me do you know how humiliating that is,3
well kind of sort of,3
and you said yes,3

shock trauma shes going to need years of therapy after this my question is how did she come to have sex with the dead man,3
what about caitlin,3
i cant say for certain until we get him back to the lab but my guess is he was masturbating his heart seized and he died thats when the girl found him something smells like shoe polish,3

you get my slapped with a fine you fight with the customers and i have to patch everything up you get us chased out of a funeral by violating a corpse to top it all off you ruin my relationship whats your encore do you anally rape my mother while pouring sugar in my gas tank you know what the real tragedy is im not even supposed to be here today,3
hermaphrodites i rented it so we could watch it together,3
unless youre out renting videos at other video stores,3
its not like im miles away,3
which means the video store is ostensibly closed,3
to talk to you,3
you were over half an hour late then all you do is come over here,3
like ten after,3
what time did you get to work today,3
how do you figure,3
what dont you do randal sometimes it seems like the only reason you come to work is to make my life miserable,3
no really what did i do that was so wrong,3
why do i say that randal forget it,3
why do you say that,3
oh please im surprised i didnt kill you,3
you still didnt have to choke me,3
jesus,3
you were saying how you couldnt initiate change yourself so i figured id help you out,3
thanks,3
i thought i was doing you a favor,3
why the fuck did you tell veronica that i was going to dump her for caitlin,3
you didnt have to choke me,3
its hard to swallow,3
the swellings not so bad but the fds stings hows your neck,3
hows your eye,3
point isim not the kind of person that disrupts things in order to shit comfortably,3
lovely story,3
my mother told me once that when i as three my potty lid was closed and instead of lifting it i chose to shit my pants,3
so youll continue being miserable all the time just because you dont have the guts to face change,3
jesus h christ i cant,3
whore you kidding you can so,3
i cant all right jesus would you leave me alone i cant make changes like that in my life if i could i wouldbut i dont have the ability to risk comfortable situations on the big money and the fabulous prizes,3
make them change,3
what do you want me to say yes i suppose some of the things youre saying may be true but thats the way things are its not going to change,3
melodrama coming from you seems about as natural as an oral bowel movement,3
caitlin and i cant be together its impossible,3
what the dead guy shell get over fucking the dead guy shit my moms been fucking a dead guy for thirty years i call him dad,3
youre wrong things happened today okay things that probably ruined my chances with caitlin,3
am i right or what,3
if i wasnt such a fucking coward it must be so great to be able to simplify everything the way you do,3
if you want caitlin then face veronica tell her and be with caitlin if you want veronica be with veronica but dont pine for one and fuck the other man if you werent such a fucking coward,2
leave me alone,3
you date veronica because shes low maintenance and because its convenient meanwhile all you ever do is talk about caitlin you carry a torch for a girl you dated in high schoolin high school for gods sake youre twentytwo,3
leave her out of this,3
its the same thing with veronica,3
thank you why dont you go back to the video store,3
im satisfied with my situation for now you dont hear me bitching you on the other hand have been bitching all day,3
oh like your lifes any better,3
youre comfortable this is a life of convenience for you and any attempt to change it would shatter the pathetic microcosm youve fashioned for yourself,3
leave me alone,3
it is you just up and quit there are other jobs and they pay better money youre bound to be qualified for at least one of them so whats stopping you,3
as if its that easy,3
all right if you hate this job and the people and the fact that you have to come in on your day off then quit,3
what responsibility,3
its true youll sit there and blame life for dealing a cruddy hand never once accepting the responsibility for the way your situation is,3
fuck you,3
im talking about this thing you have this inability to improve your situation in life,3
what are you talking about,3
yeah you should shit or get off the pot,3
i should shit or get off the pot,3
you should shit or get off the pot,3
i was born,3
thats all bullshit you know what the real problem here is,3
my life is in the shitter right about now so if you dont mind id like to stew a bit,3
thirtyseven,3
im stuck in this pit earning less than slave wages working on my day off dealing with every backward fuck on the planet the goddamn steel shutters are locked all day i smell like shoe polish ive got an ex girlfriend whos catatonic after fucking a dead guy and my present girlfriend has sucked thirtysix dicks,3
have some chips youll feel better,3
why do i have this life,3
this life,3
this life,3
what whats with you you havent said anything for like twenty minutes what the hell is your problem,3
i think four,3
what time did we go to the funeral,3
around three or something,3
would you shut the fuck up who the fuck is in the bathroom,3
she said she did all the work,3
shut the fuck up,3
you just fucked a total stranger,3
could be,3
maybe the asian design major slipped her some opium,3
fuck you,3
i love your sexy talk its so kindergarten poopoo weewee,2
i told her that she said she didnt need any why dont you join her man make a little bathroom bambam,3
theres no lights back there,3
bunch of savages in this town hey caitlins in the back you might want to see if shes okay shes been back there a long time,3
who eats cock,3
ill read the book,3
all right but youre missing out chicks with dicks,3
i might be leaving early to go out with caitlin in which case youll have to close the store tonight,3
you want me to bring the vcr over here so we can watch this,3
in my absence try not to sell cigarettes to any newborns,3
youre a snake,3
no dont bring it up i dont want to think about that now let me enjoy this hour of bliss ill think about all of that later in the meantime nobody mentions the v word,3
hey what about veronica,3
this is my way of spitting water at life,3
what happened to title dictates behavior,3
watch the store while i go home and change,3
i feel so ineffectual is there anything i can do for you,3
she went home shes getting ready and were going out,3
wow youve had quite an evening,3
im not,3
youre kidding,3
shes not going to marry that guy she went home to tell her mother,3
what did she say,3
im not she just left,3
now i know youre lying,3
no im happy because caitlin came to see me,3
youre happy to get a fine,3
im happy,3
youre happy,3
because im happy,3
then why arent you like screaming at me right now,3
i swear i couldnt make this kind of hell up,3
youre lying,3
because im here,3
then how come you got the fine,3
as opposed to the hundreds of other children you let buy cigarettes whenever you work here,3
holy shit that girl,3
little girl maybe five years old,3
really,3
i dont you did,3
i thought you never sold cigarettes to kids,3
living proof,3
i didnt think they even enforced this,3
youre bullshitting,3
five hundred dollars,3
no way,3
i got fined for selling cigarettes to a minor,3
i like to expand my horizons,3
and this is what you rented,3
hermaphroditic porn starlets with both organs you should see the box beautiful women with dicks that put mine to shame,3
whatd you rent best of both worlds,3
get to work,3
i know im your hero,3
please get the hell out of here,3
i like to think im a master of my own destiny,3
youre a danger to both the dead and the living,3
if title dictated my behavior as a clerk serving the public i wouldnt be allowed to spit a mouthful of water at that guy but i did so my point is that people dictate their own behavior hence even though im a clerk in this video store i choose to go rent videos at big choice agreed,3
what,3
and two to make a point title does not dictate behavior,3
jesus,3
two reasons one i hate when the people cant shut up about the stupid tabloid headlines,3
what the fuck did you do that for,3
not yet,3
thats stretching it youre not being asked to slay children or anything,3
exactly,3
the reasons you wont let me borrow your car is because i have a title and a job description and im supposed to follow it right,3
what,3
so your argument is that title dictates behavior,3
its going to have to do for now considering that its my car thats up for request can i help you,3
you know what i dont think i care for your rationale,3
theres a difference those were obligations obligations that could not have been met at any later date now renting videosthats just gratuitous not to mention illogical considering you work in a video store,3
i see so playing hockey and attending wakesthese practices are standard operating procedure,3
we are employees of quick stop convenience and rst video respectively as such we have certain responsibilities whichthough it may seem cruel and unusualdoes include manning our posts until closing,3
if you must,3
may i be blunt with you,3
let me borrow your car,3
can you imagine being halfway decent to the customers at least some of the time,3
you work in a video store,3
whats that for,3
you want to rent a movie,3
i want to rent a movie,3
why should i loan you my car,3
fine just lend me your car,3
i dont want to talk to you,3
let me borrow your car,3
just go go open the video store,3
so theyll put her back in its not like its gonna matter if she breaks something,3
her fucking body fell out,3
so the casket fell over big deal,3
does anyone ever knock over a casket on purpose,3
i was just leaning on it it was an accident,3
you knocked the fucking casket over for chrissakes,3
im telling you it wasnt my fault,3
i cant fucking believe you,3
nobodys there its four oclock on a saturday how many people ever come to the store at four on a saturday,3
i cant help it at least when we were playing hockey outside i could see if anyone wanted to go in,3
listen to you,3
i know it was a bad idea to close the store,3
i never tried it,3
yeah like you said you know i guess everyone tries it sooner of later,3
what your dick,3
you know,3
reach what,3
i could never reach,3
yeah but at what a price,3
he made it hunhh,3
balls resting on his lips,3
his dick was in his mouth,3
my cousin my aunt found him on his bed doubled over himself with his legs on top dick in his mouth my aunt freaked out it was a mess,3
who found him,3
no because you wont admit to it as if a guys a fucking pervert because he tries to go down on himself youre as curious as the rest of us pal youve tried it,3
because i never tried to suck my own dick,3
yeah sure youre so repressed,3
no,3
come on havent you ever tried to suck your own dick,2
oh my god,3
i swear,3
stop it,3
bible truth,3
shut the hell up,3
he broke his neck trying to suck his own dick,3
thats embarrassing,3
broke his neck,3
howd he die,3
thats nothing compared to how my cousin walter died,3
an embarrassing way to die,3
an embolism in a pool,3
twentytwo same as us,3
she was pretty young hunhh,3
thanks for putting me in a tough spot youre a good friend,3
you were saying,3
exactly which means i cant close it for another hour so we can both go to a wake,3
you just closed the store to play hockey on the roof,3
i cant close the store,3
im going with you,3
im not taking you to this funeral,3
she meant nothing to you either until i told you she died,3
she meant nothing to you,3
if you go i go,3
dont be an asshole somebody has to stay with the store,3
but i love gatherings isnt it ironic,3
you hate people,3
im not missing whats probably going to be the social event of the season,3
stop it this is beneath even you,3
true but do you know how many people are going to be there all of our old classmates to say the least,3
you hardly knew her,3
wait wait wait has it occurred to you that i might bereaved as well,3
youve gotta watch the store i have to go to this,3
one night only shes buried in the morning,3
shit what about tomorrow,3
paulsens funeral parlor the next show is at four,3
what,3
its today,3
why not,3
no youre not,3
im gonna go to her wake,3
youve had sex with a dead person,3
number six,3
correct me if im wrong but wasnt she one of the illustrious twelve,3
i havent seen her in almost two years,3
she was swimming at the ymca pool when it happened died midbackstroke,3
jesus,3
embolism in her brain yesterday,3
how when,3
sanfords brother dates her cousin he found out this morning,3
oh my god,3
no im serious,3
yeah right,3
julie dwyer died,3
i still cant believe caitlins getting married,3
you know what sanford told me,3
its not like were gonna sell out,3
after an exhausting game like that i can believe it,3
exactly they drank it all,3
what happened to all the gatorade,3
gatorade,3
bitch bitch bitch you want something to drink,2
randal twelve minutes is not a game jesus its barely a warmup,3
hockeys hockey at least we got to play,3
one ball they come all the way here i close the damn store for one ball,3
helluva game,3
then wherere we gonna play,3
were not playing in the street,3
look who youre asking here howre we gonna block off the street,3
i dont know you going to lock the video store,3
are you gonna lock the store,3
can we not talk about this,3
design major,3
at least let me maintain some semblance of managerial control here,3
hes blunt but hes got a point,3
i just want to play hockey like i was scheduled to,3
no argument here insubordination rules,3
i told him i had a game today its his own fault,3
ive gotta tell you my friend this is one of the ballsiest moves ive ever been privy to i never would have thought you capable of such blatant disregard of store policy,3
pull my laces tighter,3
youve got a customer,3
at least were stuck here together,3
i cant believe im going to miss the game,3
see there you go again,3
sorry,3
dont yell at me pal,3
would you shut the hell up with that shit its not helping,3
because you buckled,3
im going to miss the game,3
the fact that im right about your buckling,3
you know what pisses me off the most,3
yes you do you always back down you assume blame that isnt yours you come in when called as opposed to enjoying your day off you buckle like a belt,3
i dont back down,3
that seems to be the leitmotif in your life ever backing down,3
i know,3
i heard you apologize why you have every right in the world to be mad,3
what,3
whyd you apologize,3
fuck,3
so whatyoure stuck here all day,3
not a fucking word slippery shit,3
he didnt mention it when he called you this morning,3
can you believe this,3
vermont,3
the best burtless movie ever made,3
smokey three thumbs up am i right,3
can you come next door i gotta make a phone call,3
shut up yes ive calmed down im still not happy about it but ive been able to deal,3
thirtyseven,3
veronica,3
jesus you got a onetrack mind its always caitlin caitlin caitlin,3
because my exgirlfriend is getting married,3
why not,3
no,3
all of them,3
which ones,3
you know who i can do without i could do without the people in the video store,3
the women that go through every gallon of milk looking for a later date as if somewherebeyond all the other gallonsis a container of milk that wont go bad for like a decade,3
the milkmaids,3
the milkmaids,3
lets hear it,3
its not really anyone per se its more of separate groupings,3
how can you lie like that why dont you vent vent your frustration come on who pisses you off,3
there arent,3
liar tell me there arent customers that annoy the piss out of you on a daily basis,3
what for they dont bother me if i dont bother them,3
you gotta loosen up my friend youd feel a hell of a lot better if youd rip into the occasional customer,3
im gonna hear it tomorrow,3
who cares that ladys an asshole everybody that comes in here is way too uptight this job would be great if it wasnt for the fucking customers,3
why do you do things like that you know shes going to come back and tell the boss,3
the jizzmoppers job is to clean up the booths afterward because practically everybody shoots a load against the window and i dont know if you know or not but cum leaves streaks if you dont clean it right away,3
can we talk about this later,3
think of the weirdest craziest shit youd like to see chicks do these chicks do it all they insert things into any opening in their body any opening hes led a very sheltered life,3
what kind of show,3
oh its great you step into this little booth and theres this window between you and this naked woman and she puts on this little show for like ten bucks,3
i guess not,3
nudie booth youve never been in a nudie booth,3
nudie booth,3
hes the guy in those nudiebooth joints who cleans up after each guy that jerks off,3
whats a jizzmopper,3
you know how much money the average jizzmopper make per hour,3
did you ever notice all the prices end in nine damn thats eerie,3
ill give him five more minutes then im calling the cops i dont need this man im not even supposed to be here today,3
its not like you laid the eggs yourself,3
he said it was important to have standards he said nobody has pride anymore,3
what did he say,3
i told him that and he yelled at me,3
why doesnt he just mix and match,3
obviously not look at all the cartons that didnt make the grade,3
the quest isnt going well,3
each egg has to be perfect,3
perfect dozen,3
he said he has to find a perfect dozen,3
whats he looking for,3
this guy is going through all of the eggs look,3
shes in here,3
wait,3
youll never believe what this unruly customer just said,3
all those innocent contractors hired to do a job were killed casualties of a war they had nothing to do with all right lookyoure a roofer and some juicy government contract comes your way you got the wife and kids and the twostory in suburbiathis is a government contract which means all sorts of benefits all of a sudden these leftwing militants blast you with lasers and wipe out everyone within a threemile radius you didnt ask for that you have no personal politics youre just trying to scrape out a living,3
all right so even if independent contractors are working on the death star why are you uneasy with its destruction,3
exactly in order to get it built quickly and quietly theyd hire anybody who could do the job do you think the average storm trooper knows how to install a toilet main all they know is killing and white uniforms,3
not just imperials is what youre getting at,3
a construction job of that magnitude would require a helluva lot more manpower than the imperial army had to offer ill bet there were independent contractors working on that thing plumbers aluminum siders roofers,3
so,3
the second time around it wasnt even finished yet they were still under construction,3
and the second time around,3
so when they blew it up no prob evil is punished,3
basically,3
well the thing is the first death star was manned by the imperial army storm troopers dignitariesthe only people onboard were imperials,3
and you figured it out,3
something just never sat right with me the second time they destroyed it i could never put my finger on itsomething just wasnt right,3
compliments of lando calrissian,3
and the second one was still being built when they blew it up,3
luke blew it up give credit where its due,3
now the first one they built was completed and fully operational before the rebels destroyed it,3
yeah,3
so they build another death star right,3
theres more,3
you know what else i noticed in jedi,3
i think they were catholics,3
the only problem is that at no point in the series did i ever hear leia or any of the rebels declare a particular religious belief,3
more or less,3
hence the empire was a fascist theocracy and the rebel forces were therefore battling religious persecution,3
it would stand to reason yes,3
then wouldnt that logically mean that its a theocracy if the head of the empire is a priest of some sort then it stands to reason that the government is therefore one based on religion,3
yeah,3
now hes in charge of the empire the imperial government is under his control and the entire galaxy is under imperial rule,3
i guess,3
well hes like the pope for the dark side of the force hes a holy man a shaman kind of albeit an evil one,3
how do you mean,3
right the emperor now the emperor is kind of a spiritual figure yes,3
the emperor,3
all right vaders boss,3
whats that,3
there was something else going on in jedi i never noticed it until today,3
empire had the better ending luke gets his hand cut off and finds out vaders his father han gets frozen and taken away by boba fett it ends on such a down note and thats lifea series of down endings all jedi had was a bunch of muppets,3
blasphemy,3
empire,3
which did you like better jedi or the empire strikes back,3
didnt you hear me caitlin really is getting married,3
return of the jedi,3
me pulling a can off some morons fist,3
you know what i just watched,3
do you know that article is accurate caitlins really getting married,3
you veronica caitlin and caitlins fianc??,3
all four,3
then i think all four of you had better sit down and talk it over,3
i think its safe to say yes,3
caitlins on the same wavelength,3
i think the arguments veronica and i are having are some kind of manifestation of a subconscious desire to break away from her so that i can pursue the possibility of a more meaningful relationship with caitlin,3
what about veronica,3
and shes looking to me for support and i think that this is leading our relationship to a new level,3
no no im listening shes leaving college and,3
im talking to myself here,3
oh shit ive got to place an order,3
they are when she calls me now shes a different personshes frightened and vulnerable shes about to finish college and enter the real world thats got to be scary for anyone,3
you think things would be any different now,3
im serious aside from the cheating we were a great couple thats what high schools all aboutalgebra bad lunch and infidelity,3
oh yeah,3
because there was a lot of good in our relationship,3
in light of this lurid tale i dont see how you could even romanticize your relationship with caitlinshe broke your heart and inadvertently drove men to deviant lifestyles,3
it takes different strokes to move the world,3
thats frightening,3
the two moved to idaho together after graduation they raise sheep,3

well why did you have to suck their dicks why didnt you just sleep with them like any decent person,3
and one of those guys was you the last one i might add whichif youre too stupid to comprehend means that ive been faithful to you since we met all the other guys i went with before i met you so if you want to have a complex about it go ahead but dont look at me like im the town whore because you were plenty busy yourself before you met me,3

honesty through paranoia why do you smell like shoe polish,3
theoretically people see money on the counter and nobody around they think theyre being watched,3
how do you know theyre taking the right amount of change or even paying for what they take,3

thats not the issue here those people are he cant do it alone,3
he doesnt want my help,3

why are you yelling,3
excuse me,3
why are you yelling,3
youre saying i dont understand im the uonlyu one who does understand im the one you lived with for two years im the one you made promises to im the one who spent too many nights looking up at these rocks and wondering if you were ever going to make it down in once piece or ever at all believe me theres been times i didnt know what i wanted to do more love you or hate you but the one thing in our relationship that i did know and still do know is that i uunderstand youu,3

why cant you believe that you did everything you could,3
i dont think you do,3
i know,3
a lot of things fell apart up there,3

after the funeral i just had to leave,3
maybe i can help lets see if one night i got up and packed up all my things and drove away without leaving so much as a note and stayed away for months i think what id want to do is come up with a well thoughtout reason,3
workingim trying to figure out where to start,3

the only faster way up is the east face and its smooth as glass maybe a dozen guys in the world could do it in good weather only a psycho would try it in a storm,3
mr travers is not the athletic type he needs something more direct,3

as an unmuddied lake sir clear as an azure sky of deepest summer you can rely on me sir deltoid drinks again but this time sees the teeth in the glass he groans and retches,3
thats just worries me a bit too long to long to be reasonable youre about due now by my reckoning thats why im warning you little alex to keep your handsome young proboscis out of the dirt do i make myself clear,3
nobodys got anything on me brother sir ive been out of the rookers of the milicents for a long time now,3
what gets into you all we study the problem weve been studying it for damn well near a century yes but we get no further with our studies youve got a good home here good loving parents youve got not too bad of a brain is it some devil that crawls inside of you,3
cut out all this clever talk about milicents just because the police havent picked you up lately doesnt as you very well know mean that youve not been up to some nastiness there was a bit of a nastiness last night yes some very extreme nastiness yes a few of a certain billyboys friends were ambluenced off late last night yes your name was mentioned the words got thru to me by the usual channels certain friends of yours were named also oh nobody can prove anything about anybody as usual but im warning you little alex being a good friend to you as always the one man in this sore and sick community who wants to save you from yourself deltoid makes a grab for alexs joint but finds his hand instead alex laughs derisively and rises deltoid distractedly reaches for a glass of water on the night table and fails to notice a set of false teeth soaking in them he drinks from the glass the clink of the teeth sounding like icecubes,3
ive been doing nothing i shouldnt sir the millicents have nothing on me brother sir i mean deltoid pulls alex down on the bed,3
a big black mark i tell you for every one we dont reclaim a confession of failure for every one of you who ends up in the stripy hole,3
because next time its going to be the barry place and all my work ruined if youve no respect for your horrible self you at least might have some for me whose sweated over you he slaps alex on the knee,3
well yes its just a manner of speech from your post corrective advisor to you that you watch out little alex he puts his arm round alexs shoulder,3
just a manner of speech sir,3
wrong why should you think of anything being wrong have you been doing something you shouldnt yes he shakes alexs hair,3
to what do i owe this extreme pleasure sir anything wrong sir deltoid playfully grabs alexs hair,3
no time no time yes sit sit sit alex sits next to him,3
a cup of the old chai sir,3
oh or certainly by this evening yes the evenings a great time isnt it alex boy,3
a rather intolerable pain in the head brother sir i think it should be clear by this afterlunch,3
ah alex boy awake at last yes i met your mother on the way to work yes she gave me the key she said something about a pain somewhere hence not at school yes,3
well done frank julian get the car will you please,3

snuff it sir um death i mean missus er i just want to die peacefully like with no pain,3
i beg your pardon,3
that is correct sir and then all i can think about is like trying to snuff it,3
when you say this funny feeling you mean the state of mind brought on by the treatment they gave you,3
thats right er i cant listen to the 9th any more at all when i hear the 9th i get like this funny feeling,3
you mean beethovens 9th symphony,3
oh well its its not all music you see missus its just the 9th,3
so now you have the same reaction to music as you do to sex and violence,3
and it just so happened that while they were showing me a particularly bad film of like a concentration camp the background music was playing beethoven,3
its alright thank you,3
well er i think that was something that they hadnt planned for you see missus im very fond of music and always have been especially beethoven ludwig van beethoven b e e he leans over and looks at her writing in notebook,3
the newspapers mentioned that in addition to your being conditioned against acts of sex and violence youve inadvertently been conditioned against music,3

very soon now the drug will cause the subject to experience a death like paralysis together with deep feelings of terror and helplessness one of our earlier test subjects described it as being like death a sense of stifling and drowning and it is during this period we have found the subject will make his most rewarding associations between his catastrophic experience and environment and the violence he sees alex retching violently and struggling against his strait jacket,3
then there was like a sea of dirty smelly old men trying to get at your humble narrator with their feeble rookers and horny old claws it was old age having a go at youth and i darent do a single solitary thing o my brothers it being better to be hit at like that than want to be sick and feel that horrible pain the tramp crowd round alex shouting,3
they laughed at me blood and me moans this murderous young pig is a prize specimen of the cowardly brutal young he is in our midst and at our mercy give it to him thats it old tramps begin to beat at alex,3
stop him stop him a leg is stuck out and alex goes down the tramp swarm all over him,3
this is the poisonous young swine that near done me in him and his friends beat me and kicked me and thumped me alex breaks away again,3

oh thankyou your honour the tramp takes a second look at alex,3

its a stinking world because theres no law and order any more its a stinking world because it lets the young get onto the old like you done its no world for an old man any more what sort of a world is it at all men on the moon and men spinning around the earth and theres not no attention paid to earthly law and order no more the tramp starts singing again,3

ohhhh go on do me in you bastard cowards i dont want to live anyway not in a stinking world like this,3

the question is weather or not this technique really makes a man good goodness comes from within goodness is chosen when a man cannot chose he ceases to be a man,3
i dont care about the danger father i just want to be good i want for the rest of my life to be one act of goodness,3
it has not been used yet in this prison the governor has grave doubts about it and i have heard that there are very serious dangers involved,3
but it is being used isnt it father,3

youre here because you figured i might show up,3
thats ironic because were here to protect her from you,3
you should think of me as liza suttons guardian angel,3
im not sure what you mean,3
i like that a gun to your head and you ask about your partner hes okay may have a headache for a few days are you here with honorable intentions,3
youre welcome wheres my partner,3
thank you,3
i want this box rigged with a beacon,3
its okay im game,3
i dont understand,3
in jerrys safety deposit box,3
you sound so sure,3
walters had nothing to do with your fathers murder,3
not a man ezekiel walters,3
i know the story a federal judge he denied a man in prison an appeal for a new trial,3
it was my fathers kept it in his wallet he was murdered,3
you do recognize it then,3
whered you get it,3
so youll believe what i tell you next because i need to find jerry and i dont think i can do that without you,3
if this was a spy novel your next words would be something like i now know too much to live why are you telling me all this,3
belief is immaterial whats important is the truth its been my job to find jerry im very much responsible for him,3
i dont believe you,3
jerry is dangerous jerry has killed,3
im still listening,3
yes thats right,3
these things youre talking about you did them to jerry,3
umy dogu one i intend to put to sleep extrapolate from there,3
a dog,3
and what did i say,3
jerry told me he bit your nose,3
it was it was,3
missionary penance you talk about it like it was a religion,3
me i was a minor missionary a heretic really but where else could a redblooded american boy lie cheat steal and kill with the sanction and blessings of the allhighs besides now im trying to pay my penance,3
if i had any idea what to charge you with or how to prove it id arrest you right here,3
as in resulting in death we pushed the envelope until it wasnt even an envelope anymore,3
terminal,3
we experimented with hallucinogens we used electro shock to produce a vegetative state we conducted terminal experiments in sensory deprivation,3
i am impressed we used the distinctive cover as a sort of mental flash card,3
as in ucatcher in the ryeu,3
mk ultra was terminated in 1973 but not the research it was renamed ex catcher,3
ask what you can do for your country that kind of thing,3
a vulgar pop term but yes take an ordinary man and turn him into an assassin that was our goal,3
it was mind control umanchurianu ucandidateu kind of stuff right,3
years ago i worked for the cia in the mk ultra program are you familiar with it,3
truthll set you free im listening,3
what im about to tell you is partially documented the freedom of information act saw to that but much more of it isnt for reasons which will soon be regrettably clear im going to share secrets with you repeat any of it and youll simply bestow the title of paranoid upon yourself,3
please sit,3
fine what the hell is going on,3
if youre as impressed to see me as i am to see you youre very impressed indeed hows jerry feeling this morning,3
reeducating trained killers in the ways of polite society making sure the men whove gone over the edge wont hurt anyone that sort of thing,3
brain washing mind control that sort of thing,3
were very specialized,3
i didnt know the cia had psychiatrists,3
only on the football field,3
thats it i went to yale i hope you wont hold that against me,3
the truth shall make you free,3
veritas truth what is it they say about truth,3
a year ago i was leaving work late one night two guys tried to mug me it was horrible jerry came out of nowhere to my rescue then he started coming to see me couldve been a storybook if he wasnt crazy at first i did my beat to avoid him but theres something inside jerry and jerry made me see it uhe made meu usee himu that make sense,3
jerrys visits to your office why do you tolerate them why him,3
excuse me,3
a charming term now uwhy himu,3
honestly i think he has a crush on me,3
uwhy youu,3
im sorry what was the question again,3
heres a fresh one why you your colleague mr wilson says jerry wont speak to anyone else that seems oddly possessive behavior to me,3
youve asked me that one three times,3
and you have no idea where he lives,3
you already asked me that why do you insist on making me repeat myself,3
so he thinks nasa is plotting to kill the president,3
it was my dog let me ask you a question how long have you been acquainted with jerry,3
and you feel bad for it,3
you were going to ask about my nose the poor animal is slated to be destroyed today,3
excuse me,3
a dog bit it,3
can i ask you something,3
what do i look like to you switzerland,3
liza settle a bet for us,3
too bad because im terrible at yes,3
im not that good at no liza,3
look youre a nice guy but im not really dating right now,3
night after that,3
working,3
hmm how about tomorrow night,3
working,3
so you doing anything tonight,3
agent lowry,3
go ahead miss sutton,3
then this is a goddamn emergency,3
yes,3
do you uhaveu an agent lowry in your new york office,3
the office is closed for the evening is this an emergency,3
i need to speak with an agent lowry,3
federal bureau of investigation,3
what the hell does that mean,3
go to the northeast corner call a cab bring the pizza then theres a poem roses are red violets are blue if the pope goes to washington i would too,3
understood,3
ive had a lot of credentials flashed in my face liza what i saw yesterday i know not to ask questions were out shut off terminated uunderstoodu,3
we dont know who jonas is we dont know who it is were cooperating with,3
dr jonas thought you might be inclined not to cooperate why is that,3
i dont like it somethings wrong,3
it makes perfect sense field work is not our oeuvre,3
this doesnt make sense,3
ive been given a cease and desist on all matters relating to jerry fletcher were not to discuss him with the press the nypd anyone building police are to arrest him on sight and were to report any attempt he makes to contact you,3
i dont know if youre the best lawyer ive got or a high school sophomore,3
tell him im on vacation that i wont be back for two weeks,3
not today,3
ah your psychotic is here,3
i dont think so,3
that you come with me,3
what do you suggest,3
dont go home and dont go to work either one could be bad,3
im going to find him because hed find me,3
no idea honest what are you going to do,3
where do you think jerry is,3
jonas builds assassins for a living several of whom may be in place already wed like to kill a few birds with one stone,3
hes shown himself why havent you arrested him or killed him or done whatever it is you do,3
hes why i watch jerry jerrys the bait for jonas,3
and jonas,3
im it really doesnt matter think cia and exponentiate im a government employee and ive been watching jerry for awhile,3
nothing i was just making sure so who are you,3
what gave me away,3
you think we have time to fool around like this come on,3
whos the deputy director of the fbi,3
what do you mean,3
i want to believe you too,3
yeah i do,3
do you believe me,3
go ahead well be right down,3
can i talk to you a second,3
your call have a good night,3
when im ready to compare notes ill let you know,3
its his show for now look you want to get some dinner inter agency cooperation and all,3
jonas,3
wasnt my idea,3
agent lowry,3
no not yet,3
youre welcome spooks so you want to compare notes on this guy,3
i was just thinking that,3
thats the book hinkley had on him when he shot reagan,3
i dont know didnt see him,3
which way did he go,3
you dont understand,3
guys a cia shrink here to id fletcher they knew each other somehow,3
wait,3
while we walk dc police want him for assault secret service for counterfeiting and were tracking him on a string of bank robberies no one knows what the cia wants him for,3
tell me about it,3
were waiting for jurisdictional problems to be cleared up this guy fletchers something else,3
there is no abort procedure we dont know how we turned the damn thing on let alone how to turn it off,3
what,3
theres no plug to pull,3
pull the plug get her out of there,3
weve lost contact,3
ellie,3
we have benzel activation repeat we have benzel activation control to arroway you okay in there repeat control to arroway come back,3
anything happening in there el,3
im not sure we have no launch protocol the entry of the passenger is supposed to initiate activation,3
what,3
i dont know ultimately their motives may be as incomprehensible as their technology,3
you dont believe it to be tell me something doctor why do you think they would go to all this trouble bring you tens of thousands of light years and then send you home without a shred of proof sort of bad form wouldnt you say what was their intent,3
all the elements are there a woman orphaned young under a great deal of stress the failure of a project shes staked her selfworth and very sense of identity on induces a fantasy of reuniting with her father in heaven as it were is it possible,3
is it possible,3
dr arroway do you think its possible you had some kind of delusional episode,3
yes sir,3
he died in 1972,3
yes sir,3
and this is how the extraterrestrial presented himself to you as your father,3
its extremely unlikely that they had any idea what they were looking at,3
or youre our kind of people,3
its a hoax i knew it,3
what in the hell,3
how is that possible how could all that information be encoded in,3
hope theres a cartoon,3
okay fine theyve got the primes but if youre right about there being another more significant transmission still to come,3
mike because of the earths rotation were only in line with vega so many hours a day the only way to get the whole message is to cooperate with other stations if dr arroway hadnt moved quickly we could have lost key elements,3
dr arroway let me first say,3
michael kitz national security advisor,3
dr arroway,3
so there wasnt any clothes in the machine she was just sitting there on the floor with her ear pressed up against the maytag listening,3
so,3
last week about 3 am fish dr fisher was on a late shift and he found her doing laundry,3
tell me,3
nothing okay some of us have been a little not concerned exactly but,3
still settling in really wheres dr arroway,3
glad to have you david hows the new office,3
now i remember why i went into theoretical work kent,3
for giving me a chance just for a moment to feel what it must be like to be you,3
thank you,3
nothing i guess i just wanted to thank you,3
what would you have me say david,3
ellie we both know that if i was any kind of a man i never wouldve entered this race that i would have told the president straight out helen eleanor arroway is naive and strident and an enormous pain in the ass but shes got more courage and intelligence than the rest of us put together that more then anyone else on the planet shes earned this and that she should be the one to go because shes the best we have but thats not who i am i like to think its who i mightve been if things had gone a different way that i might have been worthy really worthy of what ive been given you do what you have to do and in the end as with everything it comes down to power and it isnt fair,3
good luck david,3
right well,3
this seemed best,3
you arent staying,3
maybe they are maybe this is all part of the package the building of the machine has demanded international cooperation on an unprecedented scale maybe requiring us to come together in this way was in effect part of the plan,3
they knew our level of development if as you say theyve done this many times theyd be well aware of the implications,3
i cant believe they wouldnt take something as basic as our biological needs into account,3
two years is still a hell of a long time and as far as we can tell there arent any provisions in the machine design for storing food water even air,3
excuse me im late for a meeting,3
you,3
as of three oclock this afternoon i submitted my resignation,3
what,3
ellie you should know that im no longer the presidents science advisor,3
im asking for your help david i want to go theyll need someone relatively young unattached and probably a scientist as the presidents science advisor you have enormous weight im asking if youll support my candidacy,3
i dont understand,3
david i know weve had our differences but ive always thought of you as a fair man even when weve disagreed and its in that light im hoping youll consider my request,3
itll just take a moment,3
actually im running late,3
do you have a minute,3
ellie,3
david,3
you were right ellie you were right all along,3
you mean,3
weve cracked it lunacharsky found it,3
what is it whats happened,3
interesting analogy and how guilty would we feel if we happened to destroy some microbes on a beach in africa,3
ms president this is communist paranoia right out of war of the worlds there is no reason whatsoever to believe the etis intentions are hostile we pose no threat to them it would be like us going out of our way to destroy microbes on a beach in africa,3
its not a threat ellie its a fact if youre not careful you may find yourself out in the cold very quickly play ball really its good advice,3
are you threatening me,3
i want you to listen to me carefully the minute the implications of this message became clear this stopped being simply a scientific matter and became a political one an extremely complex extremely volatile one there are forces at work here you dont understand i can help you up to a point but only up to a point,3
ellie,3
im going to convert mr scienceis therootofallevil this is absurd david we have work to do here i dont have time to play babysitter to the god squad,3
apparently hes genuinely interested in science this could be a chance to win him over,3
with me,3
the theological ramifications of all this are obvious the president feels we need to include religious interests rather than alienate them shes also named palmer joss as their liaison hes requested a meeting with you,3
what why,3
arrangements also have to be made for the vips coming in mostly religious leaders,3
rotate 90 degrees counterclock wise,3
throw a gray scale on it standard interpolation,3
you must have checked the signal for polarization modulation already,3
could it be a nested code of some sort,3
its hardly yesterday the signals been traveling for over twentysix years as for why im hoping your own expertise in decryption algorithms will help us find out to see if theres another message buried deeper in the signal,3
if its attention you want id say youve got it just one thing why vega everyones looked at vega for years with no results and now yesterday they start broadcasting primes why,3
mathematics is the only truly universal language senator we think this may be a beacon an announcement to get our attention,3
it was a worthy experiment worthy of you i was wrong about that part but its over now,3
david,3
then why havent you detected any signals if as you claim there have been thousands millions of advanced civilizations out there for millions of years then why hasnt one signal gotten through itll take a month or two for the paperwork to go through youre welcome to stay until then,3
goddamnit they are out there david,3
no youre not but the price has just gotten too high,3
the difference being what that i refuse to adopt the standard line that i dont care about the results of my work well i do care of course any discovery has to be verifiable of course it must be subject to all rigors of scientific method but i refuse to go around pretending im some kind of dispassionate automaton when its obvious to anyone with a brain im just not,3
the point is this isnt just scientific inquiry anymore its turned into some kind of personal obsession,3
im searching for patterns in the noise thats all order in the chaos im practicing listening,3
meaning i have to go defend a budget to the president and to congress and youre out here listening to washing machines,3
meaning,3
its not like youve given me much choice,3
you cant just pull the plug david,3
ellie i should have done this a long time ago certainly before i left the nsf but i wanted to give you every benefit of the doubt,3
its not enough having my search time systematically cut down you know im down to three hours a week now,3
you know why im here,3
did i tell you weve expanded the search spectrum were including several other possible magic frequencies not just the hydrogen line anymore i was trying to get inside their heads yknow and i started thinking what other constants are there in the universe besides hydrogen and then suddenly it was so obvious transcendantals right so weve been trying variations of pi,3
ellie,3
no doubt,3
now exactly its complicated,3
presidents science advisor so what you just spend all your time jetting around on air force one now,3
im surprised you even knew it was an election year,3
really congratulations by the way,3
very well since my appointment hes been made interim director,3
oh hows he doing,3
peter sends his regards,3
no thanks,3
pepsi tequila,3
then disagree but dont stand in my way,3
i disagree,3
what if youre wrong no ill grant you probabilities but as a scientist without all the evidence you cant deny the possibility and i believe even the remotest possibility of something this profoundly profound is worth investigation and worth taking a few risks,3
two theres nothing out there but noble gasses and carbon compounds and youd be wasting your time,3
youre,3
and only two probabilities one there is intelligent life in the universe but theyre so far away youll never contact it in your lifetime,3
dr drumlin we are talking about what could potentially be the most important discovery in the history of humanity there are over four hundred billion stars out there,3
im not youre far too promising a scientist to waste your considerable gifts on this nonsense,3
im willing to take that risk,3
im sorry miss arroway not only is it too speculative a subject for a doctoral dissertation at this point in your career itd be tantamount to suicide,3
well,3
whats the status of the decryption effort,3
yes of course all im saying is this message was written in the language of science mathematics and was clearly intended to be received by scientists if it had been religious in nature it should have taken the form of a burning bush or a booming voice from the sky,3
mr ranks organization represents the point of view of tens of millions of families dr arroway feel free to disagree but there wont be any suppressing of opinions here today,3
a transport so are they coming or are we going,3
and while its function remains for the moment a mystery my best guess is that it represents a transport of some kind,3
how soon will you be able to decode it,3
because you cut it from the budget three years running,3
it could be anything the first volume of some encyclopedia galactica,3
what does it say,3
i dont know maybe there is a fourth layer in there somewhere but if there is i sure as hell cant find it,3
how can that be,3
no primer,3
and,3
weve repeated a few minutes ago the message cycled back to page one,3
what,3
maybe itll be at the end of the data when the message recycles,3
theres no way of knowing without a key a primer to help us maybe never,3
a third layer,3
in ancient times when parchment was in short supply people would write over old writing it was called a palimpsest,3
what,3
analyzing signal polarization shifts,3
dr lunacharsky,3
norads not tracking any spacecraft in our vector including snoops shuttle endeavors in sleep mode,3
hows the spying tonight guys,3
i scanned it at arecibo negative results always,3
that cant be right its only twentysix light years away,3
put it on speakers,3
hydrogen times pi got it strong sucker,3
im not sure you mind checking right ascension 18 hours 34 minutes declination plus 38 degrees 41 minutes,3
got a bogey boss,3
vb10s an m dwarf signa draconis too old,3
been there done that got the tshirt,3
j39 z186,3
its incredibly rich weve been cataloging it in frames or pages right now were on 10413,3
i think we just hit the cosmic jackpot,3
its a civilian facility,3
cant we get rid of them,3
it cant be coming from vega the systems too young,3
okay lets just slow down pull up the starfield signal origin,3
thank you mr sensitive im coming at this wrong missing something something,3
youve only searched what is it sixteen hundred stars without a peep try not to take it too personally,3
never seen the optical sky myself but i hear its nice too,3
its beautiful,3
its how i hear it the displays just a little something i programmed for astronomers with the misfortune of sight,3
this is how you see the sky,3
here right around centaurus a,3
nice where,3
1 found a glitch in the timing probably a starquake,3
ellie pulsar,3
kent kent for chrissakes you must be eleanor,3
dr cullers,3
because i cant,3
so why dont you admit what by your own standards must be the truth that this experience simply didnt happen,3
but i dont believe it to be the truth,3
thank you doctor now,3
is it possible yes but,3
please answer the question doctor,3
by our standards yes,3
in fact by all the laws of physics we know what you claim to have experienced is simply impossible,3
i dont have the figures in front of me but yes that sounds about right,3
and current theory holds that to sustain the sort of wormholes youre talking about even for a fraction of a second would require more energy than our sun produces in a year is that correct,3
there is no direct evidence no,3
i dont have an official response michael all i have are the same questions you have,3
is that your official response,3
i dont understand it all i can think is that maybe because the video gear wasnt accounted for in the original plans it somehow violated the integrity of the design,3
thats terrific but theres one problem we dont have the means to receive all the data on our own,3
if at some later date the message proves harmless we can discuss sharing it with the rest of the world but until then,3
pardon me but you cant do,3
and a hundred mile airspace,3
and a hundred mile airspace,3
colonel jarrod id like a twenty mile radiosilent perimeter put around this installation immediately,3
you dont seem to understand that its your interests im trying to protect,3
which well also need the networks help to receive and decode,3
you want to classify prime numbers,3
im saying you might have consulted us the contents of this message could be extremely sensitive,3
this isnt a person to person call mr kitz i dont really think the civilization sending the message intended it just for americans,3
ill come right to the point doctor your sending this message all over the world may well be a breach of national security,3
childhood is over ellie its time to grow up,3
no please,3
its time to go home now,3
ellie this is the way its been done for billions of years,3
please if you downloaded everything about us you know the problems we face the impact it could have it could make the difference,3
no more stalling captain,3
but you said you wanted to help dont you see what it would mean,3
that isnt the way it works,3
but other people from our planet should see what ive seen they should witness this for themselves,3
eventually youll get here on your own this was just the first step in time youll take another,3
none taken but do we get to come back others of my kind i mean,3
if we dont engineer a consistent causality itll work itself out on its own and thats almost always worse ellie according to your physics none of this is possible a lot of it youre simply not capable of understanding not yet no offense,3
no i mean why so soon,3
now you go home,3
so what happens now,3
you always have been were all descendants of the same stars ellie all made of the same primordial atoms,3
all those voices you gather them all together millions of intelligences in one consciousness and now were a part of it,3
the librarian or the library,3
am i one or many,3
can you help us,3
life is unspeakably rare so whenever we do find another civilization especially one thats struggling we send a message sometimes we can offer help sometimes we cant but we always try life is simply too precious not to,3
you have your mothers hands there are no tests ellie we dont sit in judgment think of us more as librarians curators of the universes rarest and most valuable creation,3
so we passed some kind of test,3
not all some choose to stay at home and dream their dreams some never make it this far,3
the scale its just so all the civilizations you detect they all end up coming here,3
we dont know whoever they were they were gone long before we ever got here,3
so who,3
oh we didnt build it the transit system has been in place for billions of years were just its caretakers,3
and they all travel here through this wormhole subway system you built,3
many others,3
and those other docking ports i saw i mean there are others,3
you contacted us we were simply listening weve been listening for millions of years,3
why did you contact us,3
small moves captain small moves,3
can you show me,3
originally just another species like yourselves well not like you at all actually but,3
so who what are you,3
we thought this might make things a little easier,3
but youre so i mean how could you possibly when i was unconscious you downloaded my thoughts my memories even this beach ive never been here but i remember its how i always imagined pensacola,3
am i artifact or dream you might ask that about anything,3
so are you an hallucination or are little gear trains and circuit boards under your skin,3
thats my scientist,3
youre not real none of this is,3
dad but tell me how did i mean how can,3
im sorry i couldnt be there for you sweetheart,3
i used i used to dream you were alive and then id wake up and lose you all over again,3
okay,3
time to sleep now captain but you can ask more questions in the morning okay,3
thats a beauty captain now get some sleep,3
pensacola,3
okay okay there,3
mmm thats a good one maybe his echo okay no more stalling,3
could we hear god,3
big enough radio i dont see why not,3
could we hear to the moon,3
on that old shortwave maybe on a clear night come on now under the covers,3
could we hear to china,3
just be yourself captain find out where he is,3
but what do i say,3
talk to him,3
try again between the static and hey jude thats where theyre hiding,3
i cant move any smaller,3
small moves captain small moves,3
cant doctors orders the low oxygenzero gravity environment is the only thing keeping the cancer from eating me alive its all right i like it here ever try sex in zerog,3
why dont you come back with me,3
of hadden industries,3
as each component was tested and shipped off to texas a duplicate was maintained and assembled in hokkaido for backup purposes of course weve been right behind you the entire time you see my problem i couldnt appear to control too large a percentage my enemies wouldnt stand for it so i simply made sure the japanese consortium received the systems integration contract of course no one had to know the corporations involved were recently acquired whollyowned subsidiaries,3
mmm look closer,3
the systems integration site,3
hokkaido island,3
wouldnt you if you saw hitler on tv come i want to show you something,3
the gods sent us the machine because they took pity on us,3
i think whoever sent the message did it because theyre worried about us,3
you sound like joseph you think the world ends with the millennium,3
oh not quite yet at least for their sake i hope its not because theyre running out of time,3
what are you talking about its over,3
yes a shame still itd be worse if they died for nothing,3
it looks like pixie dust kent wouldve given anything to see this david too,3
japanese squid fleet they use lights to attract them to the surface then turn them into sushi,3
whats that,3
poor tired spinning girl how we feasted on her and now that weve had our fill and given her a giant dose of the clap were pulling out thats paris where my daughter was born moscow where gangsters rule the night and i gave up smoking so many battles so many lives all that sturm and drang as if it never happened if it werent for a few power grids you wouldnt know we existed,3
its so small,3
a sunrise and a sunset every forty five minutes,3
thats my girl done,3
mr hadden im a scientist i dont make deals but if you wish to give me in good faith access to your information i can assure you that i will exert all reasonable efforts to promote your cause wherever it doesnt conflict with the best interests of science or my better judgment,3
in return you get the primer and with it the power to stay in the game do we have a deal,3
and in return,3
that would seem to be the question of the hour i want to build it doctor of course im already lobbying through the usual channels of influence and corruption but as i said my colorful past has made many of those channels difficult to navigate i need someone on the inside,3
a machine but a machine that does what,3
very good doctor ive also detected structural elements back references a general movement from the simple to the complex all of which would seem to indicate instructions an enormously complicated set of instructions for building something,3
some kind of circuitry,3
even if he doesnt receive the entire transmission heaven is the mustard seed,3
youre saying there is no separate primer in the message because its on every page so the recipient can decipher it wherever he is,3
not if you think like a vegan,3
a pagebreak signal a period,3
page after page of data over sixtythree thousand in all if im not mistaken and at the end of each,3
thats my girl lights,3
if i knew you any better id say that doesnt sound like you,3
ive had a long time to make enemies dr arroway there are many governments business interests even religious leaders who would like to see me disappear and i will grant them their wish soon enough but before i do i wish to make a small contribution a final gesture of goodwill toward the people of this little planet whove given from whom ive taken so much,3
youve found it what could i possibly have that you would want mr hadden,3
oh maybe not out but definitely looking for you coat i understand youve had some difficulty locating the what are you calling it the primer that will make decryption possible ive found it,3
i didnt realize i was out,3
the powers that be have been quite busy lately falling over each other to position themselves for the game of the century if not the millennium perhaps youve noticed perhaps i could help deal you back in,3
what kind of deal,3
the infamous unfashionable bluntness youre here so we can do business i want to make a deal,3
why am i here mr hadden,3
i find it convenient to keep my interests mobile anyway ive had my fill of life on the ground after spending much of this century pursuing the evils and pleasures the world has to offer after outliving three wives and two children i find ive had quite enough of planet earth,3
you live here,3
once upon a time i was a hell of an engineer please sit doctor i have guests so rarely its important to me they feel welcome in my home did you know this was once yeltsins flying dascha that dent is where he threw a bottle of vodka at the pilot at least thats what the people who sold me the plane said,3
sr hadden you compromised our security codes,3
i think it is your naivete i like best about you eleanor oh therell be a worldwide protest but we all knew it from the very beginning you americans discovered the signal you led the decryption effort the machine is being built on your home soil of course the passenger will be an american chosen by americans anyway it is what the whole world wants no this is the big show the sort you put on better than anyone its good marketing its good casting its the american way,3
youre implying that the whole selection process is a sham,3
i do more than anything but i am also a realist soon this what is your charming term dog and pony show will finally be over and i will go home,3
i thought you were here because you want to go,3
perhaps but on the offchance that it is a doomsday device of some kind i plan to be very far away from your lovely texas when it is activated,3
id say this is slightly different,3
weve just lived through a century of incredible violence and self destruction do you call it interventionist when you stop a toddler from walking in front of a truck,3
very well assume this is true assume they have only the best of intentions suppose they decide to just step in and solve all our problems for us you have no objection to them so flagrantly intervening in human affairs,3
but the machine worked thats what ive been trying to tell everyone the tape its all there if theyd just look at the tape,3
thats one way of putting it kitz the president the isc have shut down all official communications thereve also been reports of riots flaring up across the us and europe until we figure out what went wrong things may get rough especially for you,3
peter what is going on has everyone gone completely insane,3
how long was i gone,3
what day,3
peter what are you talking about what malfunction what day is this,3
its all right the important thing is youre safe,3
wait hold on a minute,3
thank god when we lost contact i thought we thought but youre okay were still trying to determine the nature of the malfunction did you notice anything at all that,3
im im fine,3
ellie are you okay,3
like it almost there,3
like it or not,3
that you valerian,3
its really happening,3
someone tell me this is really happening,3
you too,3
its good to see you ellie,3
peter,3
ellie,3
that is true but its also true that if i really thought we wanted the same things id follow you anywhere but the truth is i dont think you want the company be honest el theres nowhere youd rather be than sitting out at some remote corner of the world searching for the answers to the mysteries of the universe and call me crazy but i just cant compete with that im sorry,3
you sonofabitch,3
ellie im getting married her names laura she came up to owens valley to do her postdoc about six months after you left,3
im serious about this peter,3
ellie,3
right now well drive down to ramey and get the base chaplain to marry us,3
jesus,3
and you think i dont want those things you think i dont stay up half the night wondering if ive made the right choice living half a world away from you wondering if any of this is worth what im giving up for it everyday lets get married,3
maybe thats the problem i want a family ellie i want kids a townhouse on l street instead of still living like a college kid a real life maybe that makes me a sellout but i dont care anymore its what i want,3
please youre just as ambitious as i am more,3
the work jesus ellie cant there just once be more to life than the work okay maybe thats the only way to get the recognition win the prizes,3
but the work,3
this is a chance to be of enormous help to other peoples research to have the power to be a real advocate where davids got blind spots,3
but what about your research,3
im going on staff at the nsf to work for drumlin,3
greenbank,3
im moving to washington,3
we could be together again,3
actually,3
peter if you can get him to do that for me hed obviously do the same for you we could,3
thirtyone linked dishes you could search more sky there in a day than you could in a year here,3
the vla,3
what if i said i could get drumlin to agree to sell you time in new mexico,3
its almost there the hardest part is getting someone to sell us the telescope time,3
how close are you to getting this funding put together,3
if we lived at any previous time in human history we wouldnt even have the option of failing wed have to wonder our whole lives unable to do anything about it this time right now is unique in our history in any civilizations history the moment of the acquisition of technology the moment when contact becomes possible weve already beaten incredible odds by being lucky enough to be alive now,3
ellie even if you do manage to raise the money have you thought about what it would really mean to follow through on this i mean a college fetish is one thing but were talking about your career you wont be publishing you wont be taken seriously and you could spend your entire life looking and never find anything at all,3
weve been going after some of the big multinationals but without much luck got a donation from a new york dowager weve even been thinking about selling tshirts,3
ive examined over forty stars of roughly solar spectral type but so far nothing still weve barely started,3
and,3
please any chance of that died the day david drumlin was appointed head of the nsf i have been in contact with a few other seti people weve been trying to find backing from private investors ive even managed to scrounge a couple of hours of telescope time here and there,3
any luck on the grant money,3
i keep telling myself okay thats just the price you have to do your time doing shitwork before youre allowed to get to the good stuff but if i have to catalog one more quasar god ive missed you,3
is indistinguishable from magic,3
any sufficiently advanced technology,3
its like the precopernicans who swore the sun revolved around the earth or the victorians at the end of the last century who concluded that all major discoveries had now been made i mean try to imagine civilization a thousand years ahead of us then imagine trying to explain i dunno a microwave oven to someone even a hundred years ago i mean the basic concepts didnt exist,3
they cant i think its against human nature to admit to that level of insignificance to not see yourself as basically the center of the universe,3
im just so sick of feeling defensive about the things i care about or being lumped in with the lunatic fringe by people like drumlin when if theyd just put aside their preconceptions for two seconds and look at the facts,3
what a coincidence it happens to be my fetish too,3
keep it down okay drumlin thinks im enough of a flake as it is look everyone here has their little fetishes caven goes to topless bars vernons got his carnivorous plants mine just happens to be extraterrestrial intelligence,3
i read your paper on etis its brilliant,3
yavol,3
sounds like a russian general,3
peter valerian,3
ellie arroway,3
thats what they all say,3
hes an incredible prick but i never learned so much in my life,3
its beautiful but it does get a little lonely sometimes i think the reason we build these things in such godforsaken places isnt to avoid excess radio traffic but because were all such pathetic antisocial misfits speaking of which howre you getting on with the old man,3
drumlin said youre been down at arecibo for the last year,3
something my dad they said after all the suffering after all the desolation of the void the one thing that makes the vastness tolerable is each other the one thing that makes it bearable is love,3
meaning,3
im not sure maybe it simply exists in the search for it maybe its something we have to make for ourselves,3
does that mean you think it doesnt exist,3
i dont know if it was a god it was searching for a greater one it was still searching for meaning,3
in other words,3
in other words god works in mysterious ways,3
maybe what you experienced cant be reduced to images on a videotape maybe they still plan to grant your request only in their own way in their own time or maybe its just like you said ultimately their motives may be as incomprehensible as their technology,3
but it is a good question and i suppose ill always wonder about the answer why would they send me back without proof,3
ellie if you go out there like this if you admit to even the possibility that what you experienced didnt actually happen im afraid they really will crucify you please for your own sake for the sake of the world tell them what you know to be the truth tell them it really happened,3
i want to palmer more than anything but it has to be real it has to be true,3
have you seen whats happening out there the terror the despair the world is on fire ellie people need something they can believe in something worthy and you can give it to them,3
but,3
ellie the only one holding you to that standard is you the people want to hear your story they need to hear it,3
its not enough dont you understand i know it happened but by every standard of science by every standard ive lived my life by that fact is utterly beside the point it may be true but it doesnt matter because i cant prove its real,3
ellie youre the proof you tell them your story ultimately theyll have no choice but to believe you,3
i dont have any proof palmer,3
it also makes god enormous i think of the scope of your universe ellie and it takes my breath away as it will everyone elses,3
youre sure you want to in the universe i saw were not exactly the stars of the show what happened to me makes us all seem pretty damn small,3
i do,3
they dont believe me,3
im not sure its come to that,3
so im assuming they sent you here to administer last rites,3
pretty ironic huh i had to go all the way to the center of the galaxy just to find you,3
it was quite a page turner,3
im assuming you read my deposition,3
hi,3
hi,3
and yet thats always how i seem to end up isnt it if you really do love me palmer youll leave now please,3
ellie there is no reason you have to be alone,3
i cant hear this now,3
do you really think your life is meaningless eleanor is that why youre so quick to risk it because if your life means nothing then you have nothing to lose,3
i dont know,3
and then what then youll be safe,3
dont you understand i just have to hold it together just until tomorrow,3
im in love with you ellie,3
please,3
what are my other options in fifty years never,3
please palmer if you care for me at all dont push this now,3
what are you so afraid of,3
i cant do this,3
what,3
im sorry i cant,3
ellie what is it,3
what is it,3
im sorry,3
what,3
maybe thats okay,3
i do seem to be maybe because im just a little bit terrified about tomorrow,3
youre trembling,3
thank you,3
during the crusades pilgrims who made the journey to the holy land brought back a palm frond to show theyd actually been there i thought it sort of made sense that earth is now your holy land so,3
oh i brought you something,3
the final countdown,3
so the final countdown,3
i remember you were indelicate indiscreet and entirely less than tactful sound like anyone you know,3
ellie the last time we spoke i said some things,3
what if their answer is oh thats easy a thousand years ago our world was in terrible shape our population out of control violent crime no food so we called a general council and decided to eliminate the anitsocial the weak the sick the unwanted and ever since weve been doing great,3
how do you mean,3
an excellent question doctor but what if we dont like the answer,3
another question i would ask would be a very simple one how did you do it how did you evolve as far as you have and not destroy yourselves,3
its late we should go back,3
ellie,3
what are you so afraid of ellie,3
its getting late,3
and yet youre willing to die for this cause the one thing thats given your life a sense of purpose dont you see the contradiction here,3
i dont know but as a scientist i have to consider that possibility,3
do you really believe your life is meaningless,3
maybe the reason people are having trouble finding meaning isnt because science has obscured it maybe its just revealed it isnt there,3
i dont follow,3
did you ever stop to think that maybe that isnt sciences fault but meanings,3
i dont consider you the enemy ellie im not out to get technology i only ask the question does it have to have all the answers i look out there and i see so much emptiness people are so starved for meaning and its something they just dont seem to be getting from science,3
i thought it was wellwritten heartfelt and a little bit naive but thats just the enemys perspective,3
i wont deny i was ambitious when i had my experience i wanted to tell my story to as many people as possible im the first to admit that process included making some compromises you didnt answer my question,3
im more interested in the story behind the story how a young man goes from living on the streets of south boston to being the best selling media figure rubbing elbows with the president,3
whatd you think,3
losing faith the search for meaning in the age of reason catchy,3
really,3
i read your book,3
its what my whole lifes been aimed at the only thing thats given it a sense of purpose,3
youre willing to die for this,3
if you came back if you survived at all which its pretty certain you wouldnt,3
and everybody you care about would be dead and buried,3
something like that,3
if you came back youd only be four years older but over 50 years would have passed on earth,3
if you came back,3
relativity explain this to me one more time even if you traveled near the speed of light when you came back,3
in other words,3
in other words god is one hell of an engineer,3
its too elegant the degree of economy is extraordinary its really the next logical step even on earth technology has always aspired to a condition of nature dna outclasses any computer we can come up with the human body is the most exquisitely designed machine imaginable,3
why,3
i dont think so,3
maybe youre creating a monster,3
not exactly it has organic qualities but we dont really understand how theyre integrated with the mechanical systems,3
some of my best friends are scientists theyre saying the machine is alive,3
i was referring to the selectees mingling with the selectors,3
some of my best friends are scientists,3
so is this kosher fraternizing with the enemy like this,3
prove it,3
yes very much,3
did you love him,3
i never knew my mother my father died when i was nine,3
do you love your parents,3
you may not believe this but theres a part of me that wants more than anything to believe in your god to believe that were all here for a purpose that all this means something but its because that part of me wants it so badly that im so stubborn about making sure it isnt just selfdelusion of course i want to know god if there is one but it has to be real unless i have proof how can i be sure,3
look im a reasonable person and reasonably intelligent but this experience went beyond both for the first time i had to consider the possibility that intellect as wonderful as it is is not the only way of comprehending the universe that it was too small and inadequate a tool to deal with what it was faced with,3
and theres no chance you had this experience simply because some part of you needed to have it,3
i had an experience of belonging of unconditional love and for the first time in my life i wasnt terrified and i wasnt alone,3
can you try,3
its an old story i grew up in south boston more or less on the streets by the time i was thirteen id tried my first hit of heroin by fifteen id stopped using but i was dealing fulltime by the time i was nineteen i decided i didnt want to live any more at least not in a world like that one day i got on a bus i got as far as ohio before my money ran out and after that i just kept walking didnt eat didnt sleep just walked i ended up collapsing in a wheat field there was a storm i woke up and thats about as far as wordsll go,3
now you know,3
thats not doubt thats four hundred years of science fighting a billion years of instinct i always wondered what you religious types did with your free time,3
only a tiny bit even the most devout believer is allowed a little doubt,3
i flinched,3
so if i let the pendulum go when it swings back you wouldnt flinch,3
and mind yes what are you,3
and you believe this law with all your heart and soul,3
thats not faith its physics the second law of thermodynamics,3
your faith tells you that the distance a pendulum swings from the vertical can never get bigger only smaller,3
very smooth its palmer right where i came from a palmer was a person who cheated at cards really though the bible describes a god who watches over one tiny world a few thousand years old i look out there and see a universe of hundreds of billions of galaxies each with hundreds of billions of stars i mean burn me for a heretic but your god seems awfully small,3
my fathers house has many mansions,3
well its been a while but i dont recall the bible saying too much about alien civilizations,3
how do you mean,3
what about you doesnt all of this shake your faith at all,3
spoken like a true believer,3
i guess i wouldve felt sorry for the universe,3
and what would you have done if the odds had gone against you,3
id say logic more than faith the odds were on my side,3
what im curious about are the wilderness years youre out there all alone no money mocked by the skeptics it must have taken tremendous faith,3
make that two,3
champagne please,3
id have to say i dont know enough to have one yet for the moment i dont believe the two approaches have to be mutually exclusive,3
and where exactly does that put your position,3
i agree with mr rank that there are unavoidable religious implications here but i dont think it justifies taking an alarmist position dr arroway is right their chosen means of communication was a scientific one and a scientific approach is probably appropriate at least until the theological dimensions of the problem become more apparent,3
for managing the truth but the truth wont be managed sir it stops being the truth the moment you try,3
nobody is proposing we censor the truth here doctor were simply talking about putting a mechanism in place,3
i guess id say i trust us enough to believe our response would be something to the effect of thanks for the advice but no thanks but to dilute or censor the truth for whatever reason,3
how would you propose we handle it doctor,3
you kill me you really do the first truly global apolitical event in history and you cant wait to spin it,3
yknow what fine i guess if we want them to know the truth about who we are theres no quicker way to show them,3
dr arroway you are entitled to your opinion but we feel quite strongly that it would by both irresponsible and naive to send a human being into a completely unknown completely uncontrollable situation absolutely defenseless,3
call it xenophobic paranoia dont you see the absolute absurdity of this this isnt about them its about us our violence our fear and mistrust,3
its designed purely as a defensive device call it a reasonable precaution,3
i question the thinking behind sending the first ambassador to another civilization in armed basically announcing our intentions are hostile,3
you have a question dr arroway,3
have your department make a full report,3
i dont know maybe we built the damn thing wrong maybe it was all a hoax the safest thing would probably be to do a chernobyl encase it in concrete,3
recommendations,3
as have all attempts at internal analysis weve tried sonargrams magnetic resonance gamma rays its completely impenetrable,3
thats it mike last time i checked i was still running the country although it seems that for the moment dr arroway is running the planet,3
but,3
well that would seem to decide it like it or not for the moment anyway it looks like were all in this together,3
what is it,3
oh my god,3
cut that backsass,3
but i made this arrangement,3
git movin i said,3
i dont think you understand we made a deal,3
git your shovel and git to work,3

rubens dead so stupid a cop thing a crazy kid and a buncha dumb mistakes im sorry because you and he,3
what happened to you,3
you do that one i dont want it,3
theyre not talking to me saks looks right through me i ask him for some bodies for the phones hes so encouraging you make that uyouru little job condescending bastard helen on your lists to call is san quentin daryll lee cullum,3
lets speed up the game plan call all the living serials to ask if theyve had contact with a peter kurten we could use some help on the phones,3
they get fan letters,3
great dark hall of fame all our greatest killers his greatest uheroesu he wants to be famous when theyre caught and people like me write about them we give them a kind of immortality they get thousands of letters ramirez kills eight women and gets a hundred marriage proposals a month theyre like film stars,3
its not chronological son of sam was before hillside,3
its also the major piece of evidence and it makes you a key part of his plan you cant run away from it anymore look at the order hes doing them he did three as the boston strangler just to tell us a copycat serial killer was at work then he did one like the hillside strang ler and then one as son of sam to lead us on to where and what end and hes doing more than that hes imitating each killers method as closely as he can in details injecting windex using 44 playing abba,3
they werent going to show it to me the arrogance its my ulifeu,3
i put my ass on the line giving you that,3
what i cant believe is that in an earlier life i slept with him christ any god that loved his people would give women a rewind on their life and an erase button just give me a minute here the letter is addressed to me you dont feel fear do you youre young you feel like youll live forever how wonderful,3
he said to send you his regards and to tell you that the bureau holds you in the highest esteem,3
they put merry usaksu on it,3
look in the crowd he liked to hang around and watch the cops at work,3
rubens gone to look its banged up but it looks like a 44 its son of sam is it son of sam,3
one of those goddamned car alarms whats going,3
whats that siren,3
whats that music its abba i can hear it its abba,3
helen hang up let ruben get on with his work,3
because im all youve got,3
why should i trust you,3
i did not the mouth thats what we call susan schiffer got it on her own,3
you betrayed me now every psychopath in the city knows im back in business you lied to me,3
halloran,3
im giving you clint outside,3
this one yes i was always curious about these twisted little souls but this is the first one ive felt personally terrified of hes something new and unheard of i dont know what he wants,3
youre afraid of him,3
whos going to catch him you and if you do therell be another one and one after that,3
hell get caught if he has a plan thatll be what trips him up,3
ah if you knew that youd be half way to nailing him serial killing is irrational and rigid and compulsive this guy has a plan all thought out flexible and complex hes playing a game with us who will he imitate next maybe hes doing all the serial killers in history the great innovators the murderers hall of fame just to prove hes better than all of them they got caught he didnt,3
injected windex why would he switch to a new mo,3
its what bianchi and buono injected into one of their victims,3
i know windex for gods sake i clean my own windows,3
consistency is the hobgoblin of ulittleu minds tell them to test for the chemicals found in windex thats a product for cleaning with,3
thats not consistent you said they never changed their style theyre robots,3
thats exactly i could have taken that same picture this morning,3
is that it,3
so far nothing they test for comes up positive,3
there were needle marks but no drugs in her blood,3
please thank inspector goetz for taking care of me last night,3
hello ruben so thats that,3
ruben,3
clint is putting a guard on you but if you swear to leave the computer on winona will assign him to the hall outside,3
that little winona ryder manner youre more convincing as clint eastwood,3
helen the killer directly contacted you his interest in you is uintenseu im worried about you i dont want to lose you i know this stirs up every monster under the bed but this is the only direct contact we have with him the only chance we have to trap him so you can turn internet back on or i do and we put somebody here on a 24 hour shift and you can kick scream and hyperventilate,3
have you got a warrant get the hell out o here this is the uonly space i have left in theu uworldu why cant you leave me out of it,3
he comes in the window we maybe grab him wheres the onswitch,3
i turned it off its like an open window he can climb right in,3
who turned off the internet computer,3
youre saying its the same man but hes changed his style that doesnt happen these men are robotic the murder is like a ritual the method itself is part of the pleasure,3
she was killed somewhere else and dumped outdoors in an empty lot where it says no dumping her legs pulled apart in a kind of sexual pose its all different but it seems so the same artificial and uposedu somethings wrong with it,3
then what do you need me for,3
but its a different mo,3
thats no surprise,3
weve got another one,3
i want a guard on you im worried about leaving you alone,3
hes going home he slept over because i was a little anxious,3
thats amazing a whole new book thought up in a minute very good all i know how t do is get up take a shower and go to work hope if he does another ill nail the son of bitch and theyll spell my name right in the newspaper where is andy going,3
because im his damned pinup girl his all of them they know me theyre in prisons with libraries they collect clippings im their worthy opponent you keep my name out of this,3
nobody knows you have anything to do with this case nothing has been on tv or the news why would he want to get in uyouru computer,3

how did you know they were stockings,3
where are the stockings he strangled them with,3
nothing,3
the bodies have been carefully arranged different positions but somehow the same the positions are brutal yet quite artful its like a signature hes proud of his accomplishments there are early picassos and late picassos but you always recognize the hand he wants us to recognize uhisu hand ive seen this hand before what are you hiding,3
he felt remorse he covered her,3
how do you know that,3
it was a lover or a husband someone close somebody who knew her and cared about her,3

maryjane you think that logic and police procedure order and science and method will hold back the horrors of a world gone mad and the sickness of the night i did once but you know how hell get caught hell have an accident or some cop will get lucky you cant catch him by being intelligent and working hard or the worst there are dozens of women slaughtered in the most horrible way month after month the news stories grow more grotesque and bizarre and in the city people lock their doors and windows and hurry home before dark and then one day there are no more what happened did he just stop get tired and disgusted and decide not to kill any more did he kill himself did he die in an auto accident or a fight or get sick and die its like the murderer walked off the edge of the earth and you never know but you keep asking yourself when you read about a new murder is he back,3
maryjane we call her mj,3
i know halloran whats the rest of it,3

hes hacked into her internet address hes a hacker,3
that computers wired into internet,3
in the sixties hes dead stabbed to death in prison,3
the boston strangler when was that,3

over here,3
hello i am meryhew saks the song is called murder by numbers the performers are a group called the police adam here from behavioral science is working out exactly what this perpetrator is trying to telegraph in the note this is an extremely complex case and we have a lot of fancy theories floating around were not ruling out the possib ility of three copycat serial killers we have quantico working on graphology the washington lap is cloning dna from the secretor its our feeling that the best lead we have is the two sperm samples in one of the victims we have a team sweeping sperm banks now i want to say a few word to you local people your commissioner asked for our assistance the bureau does not send us in on these cases to lord it over the local police we couldnt catch up on what you people know if we had a year we have nationwide resources and hard state of the art forensic science you have the local savvy together we can be unbeatable which one is inspector halloran,3

spokesupersonu,3
that was bundy he killed forty of them identical long hair parted in the middle alike as barbie dolls this is hopeless lets try to get time for a police spokesman to appear on college radio and tv hookups and broadcast a warning,3
so im maybe gonna lose three good cops you fucked up on this occasion but dont be so hard on yourself theres something i want you to think about the book says if you use your gun use it to kill thats what its meant to do you tried to pick this punk off with fancy shooting to keep him alive to what end youre not willing to kill you cant be a cop go get drunk i am,3
you want mine too you take his you take mine im the one fucked it up,3
nikko,3

im gonna drop charges on the breakandenter at hudsons,3
howd you get in on the deal,3
you got a suspect,3
the prowler in hudsons apartment turns out to have a meeting with a suspect,3

so what have we got,3
with the fbi theres no such thing as a little help they bury you with help explain to me about this virus no dont tell me about the virus thing is you saw it the pictures,3
we could use a little help,3
what i talk like a cop this is the way i talk i cant believe this guy saks hes a deputy assistant director of the fbi let me help you,3
oh maaaaan,3
or for some new nutcase to copycat the copycat,3
so do we tell the media and hope for somebody to come forward with information,3

inspector will you confirm somebody is copying the boston strangler this is the fourth is that correct,3
whats this about the boston strangler mj,3
detective niccoletti,3
you messed with the evidence,3
third bay area woman has been strangled but the police continue to deny that this is the work of one killer lt thomas quinn declares that the murders will be treated as unrelated crimes unless new evidence,3
i just got here talk to you later,3
confirm this third murder adds up to a pattern do we have a serial killer on the loose in the city,3
i just got here myself susan,3
whats going down with the sting in chinatown that gonna be off your plate in a week or what,3
i dont want the job dont do that to her shes worked too damned hard for it,3

she knows im catholic she never mentioned divorce not once,3

we were together six years sir,3
she left you nikko shes not your responsibility she takes very good care of herself if she wants to romance the kid it aint your business your business is to snap out of it,3
hes not treating her right,3
thats what i dont know why would you lie thats the problem i cant understand why anyone would lie,3
she lies all the time why would i say i fed her if i didnt,3
she doesnt lie you sure you fed her,3
yes i fed her if she says shes hungry shes lying to you again,3
see now youve annoyed her you know she doesnt like you to touch me does she widdle wee fing wuhve you so much did you feed her,3

why dont we save it for later its almost time for letterman,3
put in the kevin costner,3
james,3
i think hell be waiting for us at the airport,3
not yet its only beginning,3
id like to go back james,3
the traffic where is everyone theyve all gone away,3
one of my suitors,3
one of your suitors,3
i wasnt driving id left the car in the parking lot at the airport could it have been deliberate,3
my last lessons next week james my car,3
i thought that was you up there,3
id better come with you then are you sure you can drive,3
at home i couldnt face all this traffic,3
youd better drive him hes a bit shaky ill follow in my car where is yours,3
vaughan isnt interested in pedestrians,3
theyre questioning vaughan about an accident near the airport some pedestrian they think he was run over intentionally,3
is he circumcised can you imagine what his anus is like describe it to me would you like to sodomize him would you like to put your penis right into his anus thrust it up his anus tell me describe it to me tell me what you would do how would you kiss him in that car describe how youd reach over and unzip his greasy jeans then take out his penis would you kiss it or suck it right away which hand would you hold it in have you ever sucked a penis do you know what semen tastes like have you ever tasted semen some semen is saltier than others vaughans semen must be very salty,2
i think its badly scarred too from a motorcycle accident,3
have you seen his penis,2
no but when hes in that car,3
would you like to tuck him though in that car,3
hes very pale covered with scars,3
do you find him attractive,3
it does,3
he must have tucked a lot of women in that huge car of his its like a bed on wheels it must smell of semen,2
maybe i am a little james ive got to leave for the office are you going to be all right,3
youre not envious,3
im amazed that shell let you drive her,3
i thought she might come along handling a car again might be more tiring than i imagine,3
ive never really noticed is renata going with you,3
is the traffic heavier now there seem to be three times as many cars as there were before the accident,3
how can you drive james your legs you can barely walk,3
i cant sit on this balcony forever im beginning to feel like a potted plant,3
renata tells me youre going to rent a car,3
no i couldnt i feel too close to her,3
what about his wife the woman doctor have you visited her yet,3
i wish i had they bury the dead so quickly they should leave them lying around for months,3
you should have gone to the funeral,3
minute flecks were spattered across the seat and steering wheel the instrument panel was buckled inwards cracking the clock and the speedometer dials the cabin was deformed and there was dust and glass and plastic flakes everywhere inside the carpeting was damp and stank of blood and other body and machine fluids,3
after being bombarded endlessly by road safety propaganda its almost a relief to have found myself inan actual accident,3
it is,3
its about time,3
the sergeant asked me to identify it he didnt believe youd gotten out alive,3
have you seen it,3
my car not yours yours is a complete wreck the police dragged it to the pound behind the station,3
what they brought the car here,3
outside in the visitors car park,3
wheres the car,3
he was a chemical engineer with a food company,3
and her husband what was he,3
the other man the dead man his wife is a doctor dr helen remington shes here somewhere as a patient of course maybe youll find her in the hallways tomorrow on your walk,3
well yes youre getting out of bed tomorrow they want you to walk,3
thats going well then,3
yes from wendel to celebrate the license approval for our aircharter firm i forgot to tell you,3
is that a gift from wendel it has an aeronautical feel to it,3
ill listen for you buzzing over,3
if i groundloop during my flying lesson on saturday you might wake up and find me next to you,3
they consider this to be the airport hospital this ward is reserved for air crash victims the beds are kept waiting,3
not a lot of action here,3
thank you,3
there thats better,3
ive been thinking about that about you and karen,3
poor darling what can i do about karen how can i arrange to have her seduce me she desperately needs a conquest,3
we were interrupted i had to go back to the set,3
no what about your camera girl did she come,3
did you come,3
in the private aircraft hangar anybody could have walked in,3
where were you,3
yes they felt like traffic accidents,3
and did you fantasize that vaughan was photographing all these sex acts as though they were traffic accidents,3
yes i didnt plan it that way,3
and you had sex with all of these men in cars only in cars,2
the junior pathologist at ashford hospital then the husband of a colleague of mine then a trainee radiologist then the service manager at my garage,3
please finish your story,3
i dont know you can never be sure with vaughan this is his show,3
is this part of the act or are they really hurt,3
when i first met vaughan he was a specialist in international computerized traffic systems i dont know what he is now,3
oh yes i thought he was a medical photographer doing some sort of accident research he wanted every conceivable detail about our crash,3
thats vaughan he talked to you at the hospital,3
who is that the announcer do i know him,3
thats the point besides i know i can give something now that i wasnt remotely aware of before its not a matter of duty so much as of commitment,3
isnt that rather too close,3
yes,3
the road research laboratory where they simulate car crashes,3
we sat in b massive traffic jam under an offramp i dont think we moved more than fifty yards im thinking of taking up a new job with the road research laboratory they need a medical officer the salary is larger something ive got to think about now theres a certain moral virtue in being materialistic im beginning to feel well its a new approach for me in any case,3
ive found that i enjoy burying myself in heavy traffic i like to look at it yesterday i hired a taxi driver to drive me around for an hour anywhere i said,3
are we imagining it,3
its much worse now you noticed that did you the day i left the hospital i had the extraordinary feeling that all these cars were gathering for some special reason i didnt understand there seemed to be ten times as much traffic,3
look at all this traffic im not sure i can deal with it,3
do you want a cigarette i started to smoke at the hospital its rather stupid of me,3
i work in the immigration department there,3
so why the airport,3
ill wear a bloody kimono if i want to,3
i take it youre not wearing white to reassure them,3
not yet though not soon enough for some people ive already found a death in the doctors family makes the patients doubly uneasy,3
the airport why are you leaving,3
havent i to the airport if you could,3
you havent told me where were going,3
can i give you a lift i somehow find myself driving again,3
were you badly hurt i think we saw each other at the hospital i dont want the car in fact i was appalled to find that i have to pay a small fee to have it scrapped,3
i dont think we should have come here im surprised the police dont make it more difficult,3
they said it was here they told me this morning,3
its not here maybe the police are still holding it their forensic people,3
after this sort of thing how do people manage to look at a car let alone drive one im trying to find charless car,3
no thanks ill go with vaughan,3
im going to leave now do you want a lift,3
hard to say,3
what does he want from you,3
youre not jealous are you you have to understand helen and i had this strange intense experience together,3
serious but youll have to take your new friend the female crashtest dummy she dropped it off for you,3
youre kidding,3
i suspect it involves reenactments of famous car crashes you know jayne mansfield james dean albert camus,3
really what kind of exhibition is it,3
a complimentary ticket for a special stuntdriving exhibition definitely not part of the big auto show theres a map in the packet and a note requesting you be discrete about the location,3
what is it,3
i can drive,3
can you drive,3
are you still involving me in your crash,3
you were the last one i saw just before the accident do you remember we made love,3
i saw the blood it looks like motor oil,3
theres still a patch of blood there on the road did you see it,3
im sure the police would make an exception in your case,3
no,3
are we allowed to park here,3
where are you,3
i need to see you ballard i need to talk to you about the project,3
youre right ballard theres an all night carwash in the airport service area,3
he must have driven through a pool of blood if the police stop you again they may impound the car while they have the blood analyzed vaughan kneels beside him and inspects the smears of blood,3
a crude scifi concept that floats on the surface and doesnt threaten anybody i use it to test the resilience of my potential partners in psychopathology,3
what about the reshaping of the human body by modern technology i thought that was your project,3
its the future ballard and youre already part of it for the first time a benevolent psychopathology beckons towards us for example the car crash is a fertilizing rather than a destructive event a liberation of sexual energy that mediates the sexuality of those who have died with an intensity impossible in any other form to fully understand that and to live that that is my project,3
its very satisfying im not sure i understand why,3
the case could be made,3
is that why you drive this car i take it that you see kennedys assassination as a special kind of carcrash,3
no i mean a crash with a history camus facel vega or nathaniel nests station wagon grace kellys rover 3500 fix it just enough to get it rolling dont clean it dont touch anything else,3
you could get your wish at any moment,3
ive always wanted to drive a crashed car,3
its something were all intimately involved in the reshaping of the human body by modern technology,3
what exactly is your project vaughan book of crashes a medical study a sensational documentary global traffic,3
i live in my car this is my workshop,3
do you live here with seagrave,3
its not the police its the department of transport internal politics its a joke they have no idea who we really are,3
why are the police taking this all so seriously,3
yes,3
crash victim,3
oh,3
i have a goingaway gesture for you too,3
it was just a little goingaway gesture,3
ok good thats good thanks an awful lot for everything and for coming down here to see me off,3
so well meet every tuesday and friday and if you have any kind of emergency you can page me,3
are you saying im through with therapy,3
i think its about that time letty the charges against you have been dropped the drugs have evened out and you seem to be dealing with your life quite well,3
what,3
then you should call,3
i thought about calling but i want to wait until i know when ill be out,3
have you been in contact with the principal about your job,3
but what i really cant believe is that im starting to actually miss work,3
all i want you to do is think about whats best for you really think about it,3
first you tell me to do what i want to then you tell me to stop,3
i dont want to hear anymore,3
drugs can help suppress symptoms but lots of patients stop taking them when theyre on their own because the side effects are so harsh and michaels condition is often worsened by periods of stress hes been in and out of,3
look i know hes almost through with treatment here and hes on medication,3
then thats even more reason to listen look schizophrenics tend to withdraw from reality they experience emotional disturbances that result in personality changes,3
i dont need a lecture i care about michael,3
go ahead and put the guard back up letty but you need to know what youre dealing with,3
i know michaels a schizophrenic and mrs hallstroms manic depressive and john lockyer has episodes of psychosis and i heard a rumor that you suffer from delusions of grandeur,3
what about michael do you know the extent of his,3
im a grown woman dr emlee i can take care of myself,3
well letty this does present a liability issue for the hospital,3
i couldnt really say anything because of that fraternizing rule,3
i miss beast a lot too,3
the question letty is how are you feeling,3
well see about adjusting the dosage if that doesnt clear in the next how are other things going,3
the medicines still bothering me it feels like i have cotton wrapped around my brain,3
i think in the spirit of group therapy its beneficial for each of us to open ourselves up to the others,3
do we have to talk about this,3
i dont think you understand i wont wait,3
we discourage family visits for the first 48 hours after an emotional trauma like the kind youve experienced,3
i want to see my mother immediately,3
i apologize for the inconvenience but i must ask you some,3
what kind of place is this,3
what,3
patient,3
psychologist therapist whatever,3
im afraid lhes not a doctor,3
yeah and a dimple,3
this doctor was he tall with dark hair,3
well i dont have hallucinations honest,3
im the only doctor making rounds this morning,3
its hospital policy,3
i did this already,3
hello letitia im dr emlee and i have some questions to ask you,3
i know i know,3
i was so sure i really thought it would work we have plans ruth,3
i cant i cant see him there,3

do we have to talk wedding details,3
and then the gold scroll or the black romanesque print,3
ecru,3
what do you think,3
mom and i fought for 20 minutes over whether we should go with ecru invitations or brilliant white,3
youre slowing,3
i can hardly wait til youre free planning the wedding without you has been a disaster,3
that settles it im never leaving,3
loaned you and its only til you get out of here,3
i cant believe you finally gave me the shirt,3
ill be back before you can say souffle,3
letty dinners almost ready the souffle,3
no no theyve got to be puglia olives packed in a light brine with a flavor that doesnt overpower the palate,3
itll be fine,3
sage rosemary les herbes,3
whats all the dreck,3
whats the matter,3
fuck me,3
what about the souffle has that gone in,3

how,3
mom wont miss your wedding shell come around i promise she will,3
she says she wont even come if dad brings monica,3

no really tell me about the promotion,3
theres nothing to tell,3
just go ahead and tell us,3
me nothing tell me more about the job,3
whats up with you,3

i will dear i promise why mcdonalds,3
michael just got a job couldnt you congratulate him,3

and my class itll be hard to find a good substitute and what about my math program,3
ruths already taken him home,3
but what about beast wholl,3
yes,3
we all agree with the doctor dear he thinks its safer for you to stay here for a while,3
maybe i should talk about this with ruth or paul,3
i just want to go home can we go home now,3
everyone says its the best facility in the area for this sort of thing,3
im so glad to see you you cant believe the people in here theyve got patients posing as doctors,3

stop acting like youre someone special youre just like the rest of us,3
you have no right no right to take the worst thing thats ever happened to me and make it into some kind of game,3
dont take it personally,3
who do you think you are,3
its no big deal we all compare,3
you took bets on my diagnosis,3
hey there theyre showing groundhog day if you,3
that must be really difficult,3
a while i guess,3
is this really important because i dont think its a problem,3
what if its got a pattern,3
by color,3
how do you sort itby lace and cotton,3
sometimes my food and my clothes and my underwear,3
yes go right ahead,3
what about patterns do you find yourself checking and rechecking locks or washing your hands over and over again,3
no,3
let me shift gears here a minute do you ever hear voices that other people dont hear or see things they dont,3
terrific,3
chair cup and ball,3
its ok its not a passfail kind of thing,3
no 79 sorry this makes me nervous,3
i know this can be a real drag but the attending physician on day shift is required to do his own prelim exam when a patient is admitted during the night,3
i answered these questions last night,3
first off letty can you tell me where you are,3
letty,3
do you mind if i call you letitia,3
sure i understand,3
ive got a deposition that i really need to get cracking on so if you dont mind,3
im really sorry,3
i think ive heard this speech before,3
our relationship meant a lot to me too paul but its over and michael being in the hospital doesnt really change things,3
michael yes,3
i heard your friend was back in the hospital,3

oh,3
oh none none i completely understand what was going on,3
im just glad there arent any hard feelings,3
im glad you agreed to see me,3
no way you keep the ring youll come to your senses,3
heres the ring,3
youre going to throw away our life together for some shared experience with a looneytune that you misguidedly think is love,3
i love him,3
of all the crazy things i understood when you dropped out of law school and during this whole mess ive tried to be supportive but really letty what can you be thinking,3
hes a patient here,3
its a doctor isnt it thats unethical ill have him rung up on malpractice charges so fast his head will spin,3
no,3
have you been seeing another teacher,3
it doesnt matter who,3
who,3
ive met someone else,3
whoa whoa have really loved me letty its natural to be nervous but were going to work through our problems,3
i dont mean to hurt you i know this is a terrible thing and i have really loved you,3
you what,3
thats a load off my mind,3
no,3
you can tell me anything do you want to postpone the wedding is it too much pressure,3
i need to tell you something and im not sure how,3
whats so urgent youve got me worried,3
of course yes i will i do,3
so will you,3
no no,3
sure well save the formal announcement for when youre out i already told your mother i hope you dont mind,3
so what do you say let,3
no youve done a perfect job,3
its its really nice paul,3
i hope you like it its a marquis cut 15 carats they had one with emeralds around it but this was simpler more classic in its lines letty,3
or be up past ten or fraternize with other patients,3
i had to smuggle it in here i guess youre not really supposed to have jewelry,3
i just wish wed done it sooner,3
you dont have to say anything else ive known for a while that this was coming,3
exactly its time to make decisions,3
i know we cant just keep going through the motions,3
i talked to ruth a little bit and i think its about time,3
so ive been thinking a lot,3
especially now,3
especially this last year,3
no,3
this has been really difficult this whole thing,3
yes i suppose so,3
i think we need to talk about some things,3
of course not no is that why youre here,3
something you did,3
i hope it wasnt something i did,3
thats a big question,3
are you all right,3
yeah i guess its all right,3
its prettier here than i thought it would be,3
i think youre overreacting,3
im going to the store,3
sure why,3
can you loan me a 20,3
what are you doing,3
yes,3
you know what i think we need martinis how about martinis to celebrate,3
you just need to get more organized l,3
yeah,3
of course it will remember the big talent show you planned last year and what about the christmas benefit when santa canceled at the last minute but you still pulled it off,3
i dont think so,3
come on letty itll get done,3
no i cant ive already convinced both mom and dad to come,3
you can get out of the dinner,3
its just ive got those parent conferences and im supposed to set up the math program by next week and shopping for ruths dress and that that engagement dinner,3
no its not like that,3
maybe you ought to see a doctor,3
im sorry im justim so tired lately,3
forget i asked,3
paul i just cant go is that ok with you or am i committing some horrible crime,3
but what about that math project,3
wont it be hard for them to get a substitute this late,3
i dont feel like going to work today,3
you dont have a fever,3
im calling in sick,3
what are you doing youre going to be late,3
sure of course,3
but i thought if you dont mind you could listen and see how i come across,3
oh ok maybe,3
actually i need to review the deposition questions tonight maybe tomorrow,3
i mean tonight,3
i was thinking dinner on friday with james and meg at the saint mark,3
huntley told me today that if i come through on the benton deposition they may consider me for senior associate,3
yeah,3
good going i knew you could do it,3
my math program the superintendent said hed fund it,3
the receptionist said you called earlier about something,3
believe me i know your feelings on the matter,3
i really think if youre going to spend your life with someone you want to know them pretty damn well,3
in theres better its kind of romantic dont you think,3
can i put these here for tonight,3
shes only known the guy a few months,3
its not another one its my sister arent you happy for her,3
so another one bites the dust,3

and for my help i would get what,3
you want me to help you get out of the country,3
weve got a lot of people looking for us wed just like to go home,3
i assume you want something,3
hes recorded every conversation hes had with you for years,3
i dont think it will be a mystery much longer,3
ive got to tell you mr bonanno this guys an idiot how hes lived this long is a mystery,3
not such a good friend may i reach in my pocket,3
you rob an associate of mine a friend and,3
i guess were going to find out,3
either you are incredibly brave or incredibly stupid which one is it,3
black market art zammito got to a few key security guards at the metropolitan museum the bastaldis supplied the artists to make copies of famous works theyd switch the paintings send the originals to paris and the bastaldis would sell them to private collectors,3
what kind of business,3
laurant and vincent were in business with zammito,3
for what,3
if you think because youre a women this cant go hard on you think again,3
i dont know,3
i know they wont be home tonight,3
tonight,3
jesus,3
why do i have to pick up the tapes,3
raymond grab the tapes were leaving,3
im just setting my boundaries,3
why is everything an argument with you,3
im not any closer than you are,3
because youre the closest,3
why do i always have to answer the phone,3
get that will you,3
too risky we dont need to get pulled over because of a stolen car,3
why not just steal another one,3
she probably hid it at her place the six of us could find it in,3
forget the money weve got bigger problems than the money right now,3
were leaving raymond get the bag,3
no one has mentioned the part of the plan about us getting caught and going to prison,3
i agree with marcel i say we go to the airport and get on a plane,3
we cant,3
yeah we just go home,3
no problem,3
not a good idea someone gets a license number and it all leads back to you raymond youll steal one,3
youre always pointing out my negative qualities my analyst says positive reinforcement is a much more productive way of relating with people,3
you know what makes a good get away driver being able to get away,3
and be careful when you get near the top zero has a very long one,3
cut his pants up the leg to the groin,3
and the vodka,3
bring me the scissors,3
what about the money,3
im going to kill him myself,3
you want zero to kill him,3
bastaldis dead he is fuckin dead,3
cops,3
we are being watched daniel grabs the binoculars and looks,3
we are tired and bored with your bullshit so put that stupid little knife away before zero shoves it up your ass,3
he said to go fuck yourself,3
well see,3
and if there is then zero can kill someone,3
i just want you there in case theres trouble,3
no one then why is zero here,3
hopefully no one,3
where are you from,3
in english sami doesnt speak french,3
well think of something,3
thats an excellent plan very comforting,3
we need to rent a car and for that you need a credit card,3
what for,3
sami tomorrow you lift a wallet from someone who looks like one of us,3
why should i have to put it on the list its like saying to buy a car with tires,3
i bought everything you put on the list gloves pen knives flashlight batteries were not on the list,3
i cant believe you didnt check,3
i thought they came with batteries,3
you didnt buy batteries,3
do they come with batteries,3
im trying it doesnt work,3
turn on the flashlight,3
maybe if we gave the tapes back,3
we still have to get out of here,3
i just want to live long enough to get back to paris just long enough to kill bastaldi,3
we all agreed to it you had no way of knowing bastaldi was setting us up,3
we had a chance to walk out of zammitos house,3
what is that a threat are you fuckin threatening me marcel,3
im not a guy who is known for his patience and right now youre testing mine,3
better than spending my life crawling through windows in the middle of the night,3
you call being bastaldis lap dog better,3
this aint about that and you know it this is about you never forgiving me for leaving the crew,3
do i,3
fuck you you know id never go along with something like this,3
i think if he told me he was going to steal van goghs sunflowers in a vase i would remember it,3
youre sure,3
no,3
did you know about bastaldis deal with zammito,3
you know if you could get your nose out of bastaldis ass for two seconds you might see whats going on around you,3
the deal is whatever mr bastaldi says it is,3
everyone get some sleep were leaving in the morning,3
it was an honest mistake ridgeway ridgeroad ridgeway road,3
that moron,3
i think hes already figured that out,3
you think its smart to tell him were french,3
mr bastaldi isnt asking you if you want to go hes telling you youre going and if hes telling you youre going to be going then you are going to go,3
besides we dont know the city and,3
i promised bonanno id destroy the tapes,3
did you have to use that much explosive,3
you better,3
i will,3
im leaving you with my friends im trusting you to do the right thing today,3
does it really matter what i say,3
you havent answered my question,3
no that would have left me with nothing because all of you would be dead,3
if they had taken us by surprise they would have gotten the tapes back that would have left us with nothing,3
hey who warned you that they were coming up to the room,3
can i trust you sami,3

we have to find sophie,3
you steal some money from a man he gets over it in time but these tapes hes never going to stop looking for us,3
theyll be waiting for us at the airport,3
no chicks dig me,3
you didnt think it was little suspicious that someone you only knew for a few hours wanted to sleep with you,3

this jade fox is a woman,3
im looking for someone jade fox im a police inspector from shaan xi gen su district jade fox is a master criminal i hear she infiltrated the yus she must have come with them when they transferred here but with yus reputation i cant just go in and accuse her,3
why were you spying on the yus,3
i dont care about your sword,3
wait im a friend,3
who are you,3
thats a risk im willing to take deep down youre good even jade fox couldnt corrupt you,3
and if i use them to kill you,3
ive always wanted a disciple worthy of wudans secrets,3
why do you want to teach me,3
why should i you need practice i can teach you to fight with the green destiny but first you must learn to hold it in stillness,3
go ahead,3
real sharpness comes without effort,3
on guard,3
then tell me where jade fox is,3
stop talking like a monk just fight,3
like most things i am nothing its the same for this sword all of it is simply a state of mind,3
do you think you are a real master,3
whats it to you,3
wheres your master,3
i do as i please,3
isnt it a bit too late to be out youve brought me the sword,3
lets go,3
tell me who is your master,3
im just playing around,3
my name is li mu bai the green destiny is mine jade fox cant be your master where did you learn that xuan piu move,3
whats it to you,3
who are you why is the green destiny in your possession,3
believe me ive a lesson or two left to teach you,3
master i started learning from you in secret when i was 10 you enchanted me with the world of giang hu but once i realized i could surpass you i became so frightened everything fell apart i had no one to guide me no one to learn from,3
if i hadnt seen you fight with li mu bai id still be ignorant of all youve hidden from me,3
you wouldnt have understood even if i had tried to explain you know youve gone as far as you can go i hid my skills so as not to hurt you,3
i studied the diagrams but you hid the details,3
you think youve been teaching me all these years from the manual you couldnt even decipher the symbols,3
yes you do you are still my disciple,3
i owe you nothing,3
its the giang hu fighter lifestyle kill or be killed exciting isnt it,3
shut up,3
wherever we want well get rid of anyone in our way even your father,3
that was just for fun how can i leave where would i go,3
youre already a thief,3
ill never live as a thief,3
they wouldnt have found me if you hadnt stolen the sword like a little girl you thought stealing would be fun you too are responsible for that death come with me you dont want to waste your life as the wife of some bureaucrat denied your talent as a master and disciple we will rule,3
why are you still here you killed a policeman you should leave youll bring ruin on my whole family,3
youre home late or should i say early,3
he is my defeated foe,3
are you related to li mu bai,3
so what if i dont,3
you dont seem to understand,3
dont bother,3
in that case perhaps we could be of assistance,3
long,3
hello what is your name,3
i have a guest,3
this spells trouble,3
autumn is coming ill shut the windows for you,3
it will be just the same enough im tired,3
go to bed then miss has grown up and is getting married soon god knows what the future will bring,3
im tired now,3
dont invite danger into your fathers house,3
ill socialize with whomever i please,3
shes one of those your mother would not want you consorting with her kind,3
do you know her,3
i heard you met shu lien today,3

ive made you silk pajamas do you want to change into them,3
please sit,3
spare your energy ill be back,3
take my horse and go to the compound give this to mrs wu shell help you hurry,3
she used purple yin purple yin poison it goes straight to the heart,3
you cant die tell us what poison you used you cant die tell us the antidote you cant let li mu bai die,3
dont be a sore loser go ahead take your pick ill wait go ahead,3
without the green destiny you are nothing,3
come and get it if you can,3
dont touch it thats li mu bais sword,3
what do i care you were never a real friend anyway but i wonder how long could you last as my enemy,3
how dare you accuse us i always knew you had stolen the sword ive done nothing but protect you and your family and youre repaid me with nothing but contempt li mu bai himself spared you and all you do is insult him we wanted some peace and youve ruined it all youre no sister of mine,3
youre working together to set me up im leaving,3
li mu bai has made arrangements he sent him to wudan mountain,3
where is he now,3
he really loves you come back to peking with me well find a solution,3
you know about lo,3
go back to them first then you can decide about lo,3
they forced me to marry,3
look at the trouble youve caused now you know what giang hu life is really like if you think of me as your sister let me give you some sisterly advice you can run from marriage but not your parents,3
you sister,3
i was just passing by and wondered how you were,3
ill give them to you,3
im just borrowing some clean clothes im not staying,3
here you must be in proper attire,3
yes from the west he went undercover and and followed her here,3
you say she killed a policeman,3
then as a sister let me wish you happiness in your marriage,3
dont distance us from now on lets be like sisters,3
i am not an aristocrat as you are but i must still respect a womans duties,3
too bad for meng but its not your fault or li mu bais,3
his name was meng si zhao he was a brother to li mu bai by oath one day while in battle he was killed by the sword of li mu bais enemy after li mu bai and i went through a lot together our feelings for each other grew stronger but how could we dishonor mengs memory so the freedom you talk about i too desire it but i have never tasted it,3
no really,3
yes did you know i was once engaged to be married,3
about you and li mu bai,3
do you think so let me tell you a story,3
am i i wish i were like the heroes in the books i read like you and li mu bai i guess im happy to be marrying but to be free to live my own life to choose whom i love that is true happiness,3
you are fornuate to marry into such a noble family,3
im hardly doing a thing the less i think of it the better my parents are arranging everything the gous are a very powerful family my marrying one will be good for my fathers career,3
thank you for seeing me i hear your wedding day is near you must be overwhelmed by the preparations,3
please,3
maybe it is i wouldnt know,3
you write gracefully calligraphy is so similar to fencing,3
ill write your name just for fun,3
youre doing calligraphy,3
im bored,3
how so,3
ive missed you,3
youre probably right,3
no you couldnt roam around freely if you were,3
what do you think,3
youre not married are you,3
so i heard congratulations its the most important step in a womans life isnt it,3
you know what i mean im getting married soon but i havent lived the life i want,3
sure no place to bathe for days sleeping in fleainfested beds they tell you all about that in those books,3
but youre just like the characters in the stories,3
writers wouldnt sell many books if they told how it really is,3
ive read all about people like you roaming wild beating up anyone who gets in your way,3
fighters have rules too friendship trust integrity without rules we wouldnt survive for long,3
it must be exciting to be a fighter to be totally free,3
really,3
yes i am but i prefer the machete certain moves however call for a sword,3
youre a sword fighter too,3
youre too young to understand,3
li mu bai the famous warrior why would he give his sword to sir te,3
my friend li mu bai hes given it to sir te as a gift,3
exquisite you said it belongs to,3
beautiful but dangerous once you see it tainted with blood its beauty is hard to admire its 400 years old,3
but i have had much practice as a child in the west a platoon lived with us theyd let me play with their weapons the scabbard is so beautiful,3
the handle is heavy and the blade is no ordinary metal still the sword is the lightest of weapons youre just not used to handling it,3
its heavy for such a thin piece of metal,3
all right hurry i will hold on as long as i can,3
the antidote exists she taught it to me the formula is simple but it takes time to prepare trust me as you have helped me let me help you,3
then you have no use for the sword,3
never,3
kneel,3
give it back,3
all right if you can take back the sword in three moves ill go with you,3
what ive always wanted to teach you,3
what do you want,3
only the sword will settle this,3
lets end this here,3
not another lecture on guard,3
stop it you dont deserve the green destiny,3
make a wish lo,3
a faithful heart makes wishes come true,3
do you remember the legend of the young man,3
dont ever come back,3
jen,3
go,3
if you dont ill come after you and i wont let you off so easy,3
i will,3
keep it safe return it to me when we are together again,3
you must decide you might get tired of this life you might begin to miss your family if it were our daughter wed look for her too she would miss us jen i want you to be mine forever i will make my mark on the world i will earn your parents respect we have a legend anyone who dares to jump from the mountain god will grant his wish long ago a young mans parents were ill so he jumped he didnt die he wasnt even hurt he floated away far away never to return he knew his wish had come true if you believe it will happen the elders say a faithful heart makes wishes come true,3
dont send me back,3
it is trouble for me,3
let them look,3
your fathers men are still looking for you theyre still out there circling closer,3
i am a man and now ive found the brightest star of all,3
so youre still that little boy looking for shooting stars,3
out here you always fight for survival you have to be part of a gang to stand a chance slowly your gang becomes your family all that dark cloud stuff is just to scare people and make my life easier,3
and so the little boy became a fearsome bandit he couldnt find the stars so he stole my comb,3
when i was a boy one night i saw a thousand shooting stars i thought where did they all go im an orphan i used to look for stars alone i thought if i rode to the other end of the desert id find them ive been riding in the desert ever since,3
give it back,3
i dont take orders from anyone,3
give me back my comb,3
im sorry i guessed wrong i though you were a han,3
by the way im a real manchurian,3
not true i can use it to pick fleas from my horse,3
its mine it means a lot to me a barbarian like you wouldnt understand,3
no more hitting on the head all this trouble for a comb,3
still in a bad mood at least youre speaking whats your name,3
you coward,3
youve got quite a temper its better this way,3
my comb,3
well there used to be whats your name im lo the hans call me dark cloud im not that tall or big but im quick as lightning,3
youre tired you need rest your horse needs water theres a creek up here,3
give it back,3
lets stop a moment,3
with all the traffic on your rooftop these days it took me a while to get in here i cant wait any longer i was wrong to let you go come back with me youll be happy in the desert youll be free there,3
you shouldnt have come,3
jen,3
lo,3
ive already wasted my whole life i want to tell you with my last breath i have always loved you i would rather be a ghost drifting by your side as a condemned soul than enter heaven without you because of your love i will never be a lonely spirit,3
use it to meditate free yourself from this world as you have been taught let your soul rise to eternity with your last breath do not waste it for me,3
my life is departing ive only one breath left,3
save your strength,3
shu lien,3
mu bai hold on give me some hope,3
that cant be everything has an antithesis why not this,3
my blood will soon reverse its flow its the same poison she used to kill my master there is no antidote,3
we followed jade fox,3
jade fox drugged her how did you get here,3
what happened,3
not a bad idea tonight well get a good nights sleep at headquarters,3
ill look around and catch up later,3
what about you,3
were close to your headquarters go home and check in,3
youre right but i dont know what to do i want to be with you just like this it gives me a sense of peace,3
to repress ones feelings only makes them stronger,3
giang hu is a world of tigers and dragons full of corruption i tried sincerely to give it up but i have brought us only trouble,3
your hand rough and callused from machete practice all this time ive never had the courage to touch it,3
not everything is an illusion my hand wasnt that real,3
shu lien the things we touch have no permanence my master would say there is nothing we can hold on to in this world only by letting go can we truly possess what is real,3
all right ill write you an introduction take it to wudan wait there for news from me,3
dont you want to see her again,3
shes out there but i doubt shell show herself well keep our eyes open sooner or later shell come for the girl,3
you think jade fox will show up,3
just be patient with me shu lien,3
i wish there were something more i could do to help you,3
i thought by giving away the sword i could escape the giang hu world but the cycle of bloodshed continues,3
its not our affair even if wudan accepts her her husband might object,3
for her they might make an exception if not im afraid shell become a poisoned dragon,3
but wudan does not accept women,3
thats not for her she should come to wudan and become a disciple,3
shes an aristocrats daughter shes not one of us in any case it will all be over soon youll kill fox and shell marry,3
she needs direction and training,3
i knew she would intrigue you,3
you did your job well but this girl i saw her last night,3
my job was to get the sword back without embarassing anyone i wasnt about to ruin her life or her fathers,3
true but i must borrow it for one last mission jade fox must die at its edge did you know what you were hiding when you covered for that girl,3
but its not your sword anymore you gave it to sir te,3
i admit getting it back makes me realize how much id missed it,3
well we had talked,3
then why did you come,3
i dont know it was stolen until i got here,3
what do you mean didnt you come back here for it,3
thats not what i meant i dont care about the sword,3
no id already sent them home you can blame me for losing the sword but please trust that ill get it back soon using my own methods,3
but your men are watching over yus compund,3
no not yet,3
have you questioned him yet,3
it was bo sir tes man i hear he followed the thief to the yus,3
it says jade fox is hiding at yus on the night of the theft there was a brawl near yus were you involved,3
no,3
did you see who posted it,3
be careful sir te requires discretion official business is difficult enough dont let personal feelings make it worse and i dont know even this poster could be some sort of trap,3
so i shall avenge my masters death after all,3
is there any place safer than under the nose of governor yu,3
i didnt think shed dare come back to peking,3
you always suspected shed fled to the west,3
jade fox impossible,3
what have you discovered,3
but something is going on at the yu household,3
sir te believes its a ploy cast suspicion on governor yu,3
perhaps,3
join me once you have finished i can wait for you in peking,3
first i must visit my masters grave its been many years since jade fox murdered him i have yet to avenge his death and yet im thinking of quitting i must pray for his forgiveness,3
come with me to peking you can give the sword to sir te yourself itll be just like old times,3
so what will you do now,3
its time for me to leave it behind,3
you use it justly youre worthy of it,3
too many men have died at its edge it only looks pure because blood washes so easily from its blade,3
i dont understand how can you part with it it has always been with you,3
i am he has always been our greatest protector,3
the green destiny sword youre giving it to sir te,3
perhaps i could ask you to deliver something to sir te for me,3
were preparing a convoy for a delivery to peking,3
something i cant let go of you are leaving soon,3
what was it,3
no i didnt feel the bliss of enlightenment instead i was surrounded by an endless sorrow i couldnt bear it i broke off my meditation i couldnt go on there was something pulling me back,3
you were enlightened,3
during my meditation training i came to a place of deep silence i was surrounded by light time and space disappeared i had come to a place my master had never told me about,3
why youre a wudan fighter training is everything,3
i left the training early,3
the mountain must be so peaceful i envy you my work keeps me so busy i hardly get any rest,3
yes,3
monk zheng said you were at wudan mountain he said you were practicing deep meditation,3
fine,3
good and how are you,3
it has hows business,3
mu baiits been too long,3
i doubt it this thief it very unusual,3
maybe the murderer and the thief are one and the same,3
a female criminal now thats news,3
yes the very killer of li mu bais own master last night she killed a policeman who had tracked her down,3
a murderer,3
no mercy will be shown toward the murderer who turned up in peking,3
but dont be too lenient,3
sir te knows that even wellmeaning people can make mistakes that can bring ruin to themselves and their families,3
thats good sometimes the help cant keep their hands to themselves its very embarassing,3
we know who stole the missing item if the thief returns it im sure sir te will pursue the matter no further,3
i heard sir te lost something and now madame tes not feeling well,3
im sorry shes not feeling well enough to receive you today,3
madam te is certainly spoiling us with these wedding gifts shes being so considerate,3
father let me avenge my mothers death,3
if you surrender now youll suffer less but if you resist i wont stop until youre dead,3
well settle this at midnight on yellow hill good the fox is out of her hole,3
what does it say,3
theyre gone,3
father,3
youre mistaken were just street performers we were rehearsing,3
we must avenge mother,3
its jade fox,3
the best way to trap a fox is through her cubs,3
what do you have in mind,3
sir te can you find some excuse to invite madam yu and her daughter,3
this is a delicate matter,3
we must be careful governor yu is a court official and in charge of security any disturbance will cast suspicion on him it might get sir te in trouble,3
then someones trying to set him up we should inform li mu bai,3
but the sword could be in his compound,3
yes though i doubt hes involved in this,3
has governor yu ever seen the sword,3
when it comes to emotions even great heroes can be idiots tell me if li mu bai is not more open the next time you see him ill give him an earful,3
i beg your pardon li mu bai and i arent cowards,3
dont be coy ive always known about your feelings for each other all these years its a shame neither of you is brave enough to admit the truth to the other youre both wasting precious time,3
i dont know,3
li mu bai giving up his sword and his warrior days maybe hes trying to tell you something,3
please sir te what is it,3
please do not be such a stranger youll stay the night as my guest now shu lien tell me something and forgive me for prying your father was a great friend to me and i think of you as my own daughter,3
youve always been so good to li mu bai and me please accept our thanks,3
all right ill act as the swords custodian,3
sir te it has brought him as much trouble as glory help him to leave these troubles behind otherwise hell never be able to start anew,3
this is lis personal sword a great heros weapon he is the only one in the world worthy of carrying it its too fine a gift i cannot accept it,3
i call it blood detective if you want you can call it graffiti,3
what in the hell do you call that,3

you know you could at least have the decency of telling me whos badmouthing me so i might have the opportunity to confront them face to face how do you know its not some girl whos pissed off at me for breaking up with her,3
this is my favorite part even more treacherous and dangerous than he is charming and fascinating he has never taken a single step or spoken a single word without some dishonorable or criminal intention every young girl he has successfully pursued has regretted it,3

its not really important,3
who the hell is taking the time to write letters spreading this shit about me,3
im sorry i didnt mean to upset you but you still didnt answer the question,3
well maybe you should get to know the person before you judge them instead of listening to some bullshit gossip,3
a friend wrote me,3
how do you know ive been with several women,3
take yourself youve slept with several women are you happier because of it,3
oh really,3
i wasnt knocking anything its just my belief that people shouldnt actually experience the act of love until they are in love and that people our age are too immature to be in touch with those emotions,3
most people are morons i mean who are you to knock what youve never experienced,3
thats a first most people praised me for it,3
i must say i found it rather appalling,3
you did,3
i read your teen beat manifesto,3

annette,3
you wanted an answer to your question,3
mind if i ask what youre doing in my room,3
i have a flair for drama,3
a little melodramatic dont you think,3
i knew this guy last summer in the hamptons he and his girlfriend at the time were madly in love with each other but she had this huge weight problem his friends taunted him mercilessly about it you know how do you breathe when she sits on your face its embarrassing for you to be seen with her finally he couldnt take it anymore and decided to dump her she flipped and he went on the defensive i distinctly remember him saying the same thing over and over again im completely fucked up im completely fucked up im completely fucked up poor fatty never had a chance,3
screening calls any suggestions,3
how have you dumped girls in the past,3
ive never done this before,3
why so nervous,3
then do me a favor and get rid of her if not for me then do it for you look at yourself youre a joke shes turned you into jelly what do you want to be one of those losers who walk down the halls holding hands and smiling people used to respect you they feared you and now youre going to throw that all away,3
thats not fair youre taking all the fun out of it,3
is that what you think,3
i cant believe youre reacting this way youre just saying this because you lost the bet,3
not anymore you dont its obvious,3
kathryn you know i love you ive always loved you,3
at first it was but now its become something bigger,3
oh come on kathryn it was just a contest,3

well you obviously wanted me to witness your little adventure or else you wouldnt have invited me in,3

youre telling me you had the chance to fuck her and you didnt god are you a chump,2
i dont know she was lying on the bed ready to do it but i i dont i was i just didnt feel right about it,3
so what went wrong,3

oh sis youre so tense,3
thank you mmmm that feels good,3
im at your service,3
but who will they turn to for help,3
i rat cecile out to mommy mommy goes ballistic and ends their relationship boo hoo,3
whats your plan of attack,3
not to mention court reynolds unfortunately ronalds moving with the speed of a special olympic bobsledder,3
ooo im sure mrs caldwell will love that,3
the plot thickens it appears that cecile has fallen for her music teacher,3
call cecile up and get her to come over ill bust that cherry in a heartbeat,3
no,3
i now plan to devote all my energies to destroying the douche bag any luck corrupting her daughter,3
interesting,3
you ready for this ive recently discovered that our good friend mrs caldwell is the one who sent the letter to annette urging her to stay away from me,3
whats wrong with you,3
shhh,3
you would not believe what,3
okay,3
call me later,3
blow me,3
loser,3
im working on it,3
fuck her yet,2
it would feel so yummy,3
even there,3
you can put it anywhere,3
because im the only person you cant control and it kills you,3
what makes you think id go for that bet thats a seventy thousand dollar car,3
in english ill fuck your brains out,2
be more specific,3
ill give you something youve been jerking off about ever since our parents got married,3
and if i win,3
if you lose then that hot little porsche of yours is mine,3
what are the terms,3
could you be more desperate to read it,3
oh gee your journal could you be more queer,3
oh well duty calls time to add another chapter to my work of art,3
ill think about it,3
care to make a wager on that,3
you dont stand a chance even this is out of your league,3
it just so happens were not in kansas anymore our little angels father has accepted the new headmaster position at oakwood shes staying with my aunt up in connecticut while daddy sells his house can you imagine what this would do for my reputation screwing the new headmasters virginal daughter before school starts it will be my greatest victory,3
bfd what do you plan to do fly to kansas and woo little dorothy,3
oh yes ive read it over and over again this babys the real deal daddys little angel a paradigm of chastity and virtue,3
jesus christ is she for real,3
shut up and turn to page 64,3
im not interested in the latest dating tips from jonathan taylor thomas,3
that was just simple revenge what i have planned requires sheer genius,3
oh but diddling the therapists daughter is a challenge,3
oh come on kathryn its too easy but i thought high school was only four years i mean please she knows nothing shes seen nothing i could have her under the table at au bar sucking me off before the appetizer arrived go get one of those moron friends of yours to do it i have a reputation to uphold,3
why not,3
shes quite cute you know young supple breasts a tight firm ass and an uncharted pootie,2
sounds intriguing,3
i need you to seduce our young cecile introduce her to your world of decadence and debauchery,3
i see your point though why should i care,3
because if theres an attack made on court it could be traced back to me i cant allow that to happen everybody loves me and i intend to keep it that way,3
why go through cecile why not just attack court,3
keep your friends close and your enemies closer when i get through with her shell be the premier blow job queen of the tristate area and poor little courts heart will be shattered,3
so thats what this is all about well get together and plan your curriculum,3
i dont find this very funny,3
you dont mean,3
in any event my feelings were hurt when i learned that he had fallen for someone else someone chaste pure innocent,3
sorry,3
what,3
oh poor baby well you can relax i have a mission for you,3
hopefully though she suspects that your decrepit alcoholic father is diddling the maid,3
lovely how is your gold digging whore of a mother enjoying bali zipping through my inheritance per usual,3
im just taking the poor girl under my wing,3
do you care to tell me what mrs whitetrash and her stupid daughter are doing in my house,3
outstanding,3
ceciles attending oakwood in the fall,3
its the least i can do,3
oh please i cant have you do that,3
let me get that for you,3
absolutely,3
you will be discreet about this,3
i cant thank you enough,3
black,3
i know shes so young and hes so,3
ronald thats crazy,3
its worse i think theres something going on between cecile and her music teacher,3
kathryn you have my word it isnt drugs is it,3
well you promise you wont say anything to her weve developed a friendship and,3
what about her,3
its cecile,3
not at all whats wrong,3
i hope i didnt keep you from something,3
i got your message and came as quick as i could,3
like your stepbrother sebastian i cant believe they didnt expel him after what he did to the school nurse,3
dont worry its totally understandable most of the boys that matriculate at oakwood are very upstanding gentleman however there are the occasional bad apples,3
thats beautiful,3
i know this sounds corny but whenever i feel temptations of peer pressure i turn to god and he helps me through the problem call me an anachronism but it works,3
how do you do it i mean with all peer pressuring that goes on in high school where do you get your strength,3
youre too kind,3
ill do my best,3
i cant tell you how happy we are that cecile is going to be attending oakwood with you this fall youve always been an inspiration to beau and i on raising her we just hope she can rise to the high standards which youve set for her,3
i guess that puts me in my place thank you for the hospitality mrs caldwell it was a true awakening,3
oh dont give me any of that racist crap my husband and i gave money to colin powell,3
first of all maam i never touched your daughter and second i would like to think that in these times someone of your status could look beyond racial lines,3
whatever you are never to set foot in this house again and you are never and i mean never to see my daughter again is that understood,3
got me off the streets i live on 59th and park,3
is that so,3
mrs caldwell i think youre misunderstanding something,3
im paying you to give cello lessons not to pervert my child,3
excuse me,3
who the hell do you think you are,3
i understand good night,3
its really important,3
ill do that,3
fine could you please see that she gets this,3
young man i already told you shes not here,3
annette annette,3
later listen were entertaining some guests so,3
do you know when shell be back,3

what time is it,3
you bastard,3
ronald im sorry,3

ronald you dont know what youre talking about,3
did you hit her,3
kathryn oh christ she got to you too,3
kathryn did you hit her,3
what are you talking about,3
where the hell do you come off hitting women,3
can we do it later ive had a really bad night and,3
it seems that you and i have some talking to do,3
hey ronald,3
how will i get to her,3
ronald emails for geeks and pedophiles be romantic write her another letter,3
she really loves me,3
youre a lucky guy,3
wow i never knew she had these kind of feelings,3
once the emptiness in amys life is filled the dream will go of itself if a up to you both of you only you two can bring her into a real world you must give her the friendship and love she craves,3
how,3
its perfectly normal for a child to dream i can see how a sensitive little girl finding this portrait would take the image of this woman and make of her an imaginary friend that image dwells only in her imagination and that image can go as quickly as it was born,3
i can see it allthe very day it began amy was lonely she was desperate for friendship i remember the night she told me she had wished on her ring that must have been the day she first wished for a friend,3
what do you mean,3
forgive me but it was superstition foolish childish wishesthat started all this,3
its been ages since ive even thought of a mummers play when i was in college we used to do them every year ?€? st george and the dragon all kinds of sword dances,3
its one of the clearest memories i have twelfth nightburning pine and mummers plays,3
i love the smell of pine,3
no i only let her go with edward its alright,3
does she go up to the farrens often,3
but quite harmless im sure,3
yes shes a little odd i understand,3
that the old actress julia farren,3
yes as a matter of fact i was on the point of telling you about it yesterday ?€? about olivers first marriage ?€? and his wifes death it has so much to do with amy ?€? although hell never realize it,3
i didnt know mr reed had been married before,3
we dont even like them ive often thought of giving it away but oliver wouldnt stand for it it was his first wifes favorite picture she was an artist,3
but you dont keep a cat do you,3
but it is a part of our lives too a part of our past its a goya reproduction those three cats are supposed to be the most beautifully drawn cats in western art,3
i know how it is my dad collects miniature canon,3
olivers pet im sure it would be the first thing hed grab if we ever had a fire,3
hello i just met amy and she pointed out where you live,3
oh hello,3
id love to,3
im so glad to have met you at last youre just as nice as amy told me you were i hope youll come to see us,3
thats exactly what i told mr reed but he insisted upon remaining home from business to talk to you miss callahan,3
to a situation really mr reed there isnt anything to worry about it was only a slap,3
all right amy go tell edward to take you,3
but it wont be christmas tomorrow,3
wouldnt it be just the same darling if daddy dropped the present at mrs farrens on his way to town tomorrow morning,3
mommy could edward take me to mrs farrens house to give her her present,3
you cant open it yet you have to put all of them under the tree until morning,3
oh thank you darling,3
all right mommy,3
look why dont you run out and play the suns shining,3
irena,3
irena,3
whats her name,3
she was very pretty,3
it was right there on top isnt she pretty,3
whered you get this darling,3
i had my breakfast while you were still asleep,3
edward will give you your breakfast amy,3
sh then you must keep it true goodnight darling,3
but its already come true,3
you mustnt tell anybody or it wont come true,3
i got my wish anyway,3
well ?€? the mother or daughter whichever one gave it to you you ask edward to go with you,3
i really dont know but i do know that you must return the ring you get edward to take you up there and bring it back to the old lady,3
are they nice,3
no dear i dont know them but ive heard about them,3
do you know the people,3
the farren house,3
on the back street ?€? a green house,3
someone gave it to you where was this old house,3
at the old house with the voice,3
but where did you get it amy,3
thats what i wished on edward says its a wishing ring and it is,3
where did you get this ring,3
i made a wish today and it came true just like edward said it would,3
sometimes,3
did your wishes ever come true,3
oh lots of times,3
did you ever make a wish,3
yes darling,3
mommy,3
oh youll remember it some time,3
the song i was trying to hum the song my friend taught me,3
what song dear,3
i suppose any note no matter how sour is a song if you hold on to it long enough,3
i wasnt saying anything i was singing,3
what are saying darling,3
i can make wishes like this come true ill be just like daddy wants me to be play with the other children not sit around by myself ?€? tell the truth,3
but edward in this kind of a wish that doesnt matter,3
you know what i wished daddy i wished i could be a good girl,3
you get your wish,3
weve got to go on amy here all this time youve let your mother and father think you had forgotten that old dream life of yours now we find youve only kept it secret,3
oliver please lets not go on with this the childs trembling,3
that darn kid i never in my life expected her to get an a in arithmetic maths is a practical science if she understands figures shes well out of her own world of makebelieve,3
whats funny,3
i suppose so,3
some day im afraid were going to have to tell her about irena,3
amy picked it off the top of that stack perhaps youd better go through the whole bunch there may be others of irena in there,3
where did you get it,3
well you know where it is,3
i havent had my breakfast,3
im sorry i was somewhere else he returns to the card game,3
its your play,3
what,3
ollie,3
i thought amy was calling i guess not,3
what is it alice,3
im not shouting at you but theres no doubt in my mind that you spoil this child,3
youre shouting at me,3
im never unfair,3
you mean you didnt it seems to me the least you could do you cant just jump at conclusions that way youre being unfair,3
well it seemed to me,3
did you hear the child out,3
amys been lying again,3

i know dear i understand but try to worry a little less about her be a little easier in your thinking and especially today ?€? lets forget about it we want a really bangup birthday party dont we,3
no its not that its because i know what can happen when people begin to lie to themselves imagine things i love amy too much to let her lose herself in a dream world where butterflies become pals i saw what happened to irena with her cat people,3
thats why i can tell you straight out you think too much about irena blame yourself for her death and its your thinking and brooding about her that makes you so unnaturally concerned about amy,3
i know that,3
im not a jealous woman oliver,3
all i have to do is look at amys eyes blue and deep like yours,3
shes not irenas child theres nothing of irena in her shes my child,3
id hate her to grow up like that,3

it got hit,3
but it was alive ?€? it was fast and strong,3
because it cant its dead,3
why is it just lying there why doesnt it get up,3
probably hit by a car hard to see things in the twilight,3
but what happened to the little deer,3
bad luck to see death in the snow,3
but i saw what it was its the little deer,3
mustnt look little miss mustnt look,3

little miss dont you never come here alone you gave me a fright you did,3

well if its a real mourning ring im going to think hard for something i want more than anything else in the world before i wish,3
theyre given to the living in memory of the dead if this is a real one i cant be sure you can make a wish and it will come true in the twinkling of an eye,3
the ring up to him whats a mourning ring,3
maybe if its a real mourning ring like we have in jamaica all you got to do is turn it on your finger close your eyes and make a wish,3
a ring that i can wish on like i wished on the candles,3
i wouldnt be surprised if it were a true wishing ring,3
its a pretty ring,3
most surely that was a nice lady to give a ring to a little girl,3
a lady threw it to me,3
thats a finelooking ring,3
look at my ring,3

sometimes i wonder if the guys were supposed to want to go out with are the ones we actually want to go out with you know,3
bianca i dont think the highlights of dating joey dorsey are going to include dooropening and coatholding,3
combination i dont know i thought hed be different more of a gentleman,3
is he oily or dry,3
he practically proposed when he found out we had the same dermatologist i mean dr bonchowski is great an all but hes not exactly relevant party conversation,3
would you mind getting me a drink cameron,3

joey,3

not all experiences are good bianca you cant always trust the people you want to,3
god youre just like him just keep me locked away in the dark so i cant experience anything for myself,3
i guess i thought i was protecting you,3
im not stupid enough to repeat your mistakes,3
thats not,3
no you didnt if you really thought i could make my own decisions you wouldve let me go out with him instead of helping daddy hold me hostage,3
i wanted to let you make up your own mind about him,3
why didnt you tell me,3
after that i swore id never do anything just because everyone else was doing it and i havent since except for bogeys party and my stunning gastrointestinal display,3
but,3
just once afterwards i told him i didnt want to anymore i wasnt ready he got pissed then he broke up with me,3
you did what,3
he said everyone was doing it so i did it,3
as in,3
now i do back then was a different story,3
but you hate joey,3
he was like a total babe,3
why,3
in 9th for a month,3

joey never told you we went out did he,3
i wish i had that luxury im the only sophomore that got asked to the prom and i cant go because you won t,3

like you care,3
listen i know you hate having to sit home because im not susie high school,3
youre welcome,3
i dont get you you act like youre too good for any of this and then you go totally apeshit when you get here,3
i really dont think i need any social advice from you right now,3
bianca i need to talk to you i need to tell you,3
can we go now,3
you are so completely unbalanced,3
yeah hes your freak friend mandellas boyfriend i guess since im not allowed to go out i should obsess over a dead guy too,3
its shakespeare maybe youve heard of him,3
like im supposed to know what that even means,3
at least im not a clouted fen sucked hedgepig,3
cant you forget for just one night that youre completely wretched,3
bogey lowensteins party is normal but youre too busy listening to bitches who need prozac to know that,3
whats normal,3
youre ruining my life because you wont be normal i cant be normal,3
i think youre a freak i think you do this to torture me and i think you suck,3
what do you think,3
oh i thought you might have a date i dont know why im bothering to ask but are you going to bogey lowensteins party saturday night,3
it means that gigglepuss is playing at club skunk and were going,3
oh my god does this mean youre becoming normal,3
can you at least start wearing a bra,3
i have the potential to smack the crap out of you if you dont get out of my way,3
nowhere hi daddy,3
whereve you been,3
i have a date daddy and he s not a captain of oppression like some men we know,3
im missing something,3
fine i see that im a prisoner in my own house im not a daughter im a possession,3
youre not going unless your sister goes end of story,3
hes not a hot rod whatever that is,3
its that hot rod joey right that s who you want me to bend my rules for,3
no but,3
the prom kat has a date,3
daddy i want to discuss the prom with you its tomorrow night,3
because shell scare them away,3
why,3
promise me you wont talk to any boys unless your sister is present,3
just for a minute,3
daddy no,3
wear the belly before you go,3
its just a party daddy,3
oh god its starting,3
if kats not going youre not going,3
daddy people expect me to be there,3
its just a party daddy but i knew youd forbid me to go since gloria steinem over there isnt going,3
otherwise known as an orgy,3
if you must know we were attempting to go to a small study group of friends,3
and wherere you going,3
daddy i,3
exactly my point,3
but she doesnt want to date,3
but its not fair shes a mutant daddy,3
then neither will you and ill get to sleep at night,3
what if she never starts dating,3
no youre not dating until your sister starts dating end of discussion,3
now dont get upset daddy but theres this boy and i think he might ask,3
just sent em through,3
padua girls one tall decent body the other one kinda short and undersexed,3
never,3
fan of a fan you see a couple of minors come in,3
didnt have you pegged for a gigglepuss fan arent they a little too preteen bellybutton ring for you,3
always a pleasure brucie,3
best case scenario youre back on the payroll for awhile,3
you humiliated the woman sacrifice yourself on the altar of dignity and even the score,3
no i m not,3
buttholus extremus but hey youre making progress,3
the hell is that what kind of guy just picks up a girl and carries her away while youre talking to her,3
extremely unfortunate maneuver,3
hell ive just been going over the whole thing in my head and,3
you told me that part already,3
its her favorite band,3
assail your ears for one night,3
okay i wasnt sure,3
hes pretty,3
dead at fortyone,3
her favorite uncle,3
its a lung cancer issue,3
number one she hates smokers,3
are you kidding hell piss himself with joy hes the ultimate kiss ass,3
will bogey get bent,3
in that case well need to make it a schoolwide blow out,3
this is it a golden opportunity patrick can ask katarina to the party,3
like we had a choice besides when you let the enemy think hes orchestrating the battle youre in a position of power we let him pretend hes calling the shots and while hes busy setting up the plan you have time to woo bianca,3
you got him involved,3
hey ive gotta have a few clients when i get to wall street,3
i thought you hated those people,3
you know if you do go out with bianca youd be set youd outrank everyone strictly alist with me by your side,3
thats what i just said,3
did she actually say shed go out with you,3
forget his reputation do you think weve got a plan or not,3
im serious man hes whacked he sold his own liver on the black market so he could buy new speakers,3
they always let felons sit in on honors biology,3
no kidding hes a criminal i heard he lit a state trooper on fire he just got out of alcatraz,3
he seems like he thrives on danger,3
what makes you think hell do it,3
you wanna go out with him,3
what about him,3
unlikely but even so she still cant go out with you so whats the point,3
i teach her french get to know her dazzle her with charm and she falls in love with me,3
the mewling rampalian wretch herself,3
thats her biancas sister,3
yeah just a minor encounter with the shrew,3
you could consecrate with her my friend,3
you mean id get a chance to talk to her,3
guess who just signed up for a tutor,3

i hear youre helpin verona,3
so what you need to do is recruit a guy wholl go out with her someone whos up for the job,3

neither has his heterosexuality,3
thats never been proven,3
william didnt even go to high school,3
william would never have gone to a state school,3
so he has this huge raging fit about sarah lawrence and insists that i go to his maledominated puking frat boy number one golf team school i have no say at all,3
you could always go with me im sure william has some friends,3
the people at this school are so incredibly foul,3
but imagine the things hed say during sex,2
i realize that the men of this fine institution are severely lacking but killing yourself so you can be with william shakespeare is beyond the scope of normal teenage obsessions youre venturing far past daytime talk show fodder and entering the world of those who need very expensive therapy,3
an attempted slit,3
whats this,3
just a little,3
mandella eat starving yourself is a very slow way to die,3
block e,3

what are you listening to chicken ass,3
youll be drinking your own piss for the glory of spain and admiral colon bastard,3
the waters going putrid in the barrels,3
i never seen heat like this not even in las minas,3
ifgodwillsit,3
asia can be found to the west and i will prove it,3
blind faith is what i consider heresy,3
dont you realize your words could be considered heretical,3
did he not choose a carpenters son to reveal himself to the world,3
if god intended our proximity to asia do you believe he would have waited for you to show it to the world,3
no the portuguese have already discovered blackskinned people i too will find other populations and bring them to the word of god,3
is that all that interests you gold,3
trade your excellency according to marco polo the kingdom of china is one of the richest of the world even the meanest buildings are roofed with gold,3
if they agree to follow me yes,3
your life and that of others,3
your eminence there is only one way to settle the matter and that is to make the journey i am ready to risk my life to prove it possible,3
excellency you are right,3
senor colon an experienced captain such as yourself will understand our concern with the crew i am not willing to have on my conscience the loss of men who would have relied upon our judgment,3
then you cannot ignore that according to their calculations the circumference of the earth is approximately 22000 leagues or more which makes the ocean uncrossable,3
i am your eminence,3
unfortunately don colon that is precisely where our opinions differ are you familiar with the work of aristotle erathostene ptolemeus,3
yes your eminence the voyage should not take more than six or seven weeks,3
you say asia can be found by sailing west,3
a waste let me tell you something arojaz if your name or mine is ever remembered it will only be because of his,3
what a tragedy what a waste of a life,3
you can see for yourself,3
on the contrary your eminence it seems to me the man is preparing his own cross,3
it wont be easy to get rid of your prophet now don sanchez,3
indeed the world is full of mercenaries and states often make use of them when it benefits them my only concern is the welfare and prosperity of spain,3
he is a mercenary did he not already try to convince the king of portugal of his absurd notions,3
naturally but i would really deplore the loss of such a potential opportunity for spain for a dispute over a point of geography,3
the judgment is ours,3
the state has some reason to be interested in this mans proposition your eminence,3
i cant keep my eyes off you i would like to catch up with all the moments i didnt spend with you,3
what is it now tell me,3
i am busy inside,3
cant you stay with us a little,3
not everything do you think i care im a free man again riches dont make a man rich they only make him busier,3
they took everything,3
they tried but i didnt let them,3
god youre so beautiful i cant believe no other man has ever taken you away from me,3
i can arrange for the queen to take fernando and diego into her service,3
you dont usually ask,3
beatrix i want to ask you something,3
thats something you cant decide,3
i dont want you to wait for me,3
im not asking you to swear to anything,3
thank god,3
she said yes,3
i find that hard to believe,3
perhaps i was never meant to live with a woman,3
id love to argue with you sometimes but youre never here,3
are we going to argue,3
well thats true i have a child by a man who wont marry me whos always leaving,3
i havent given you much of a life,3

i understand that you will soon be appointing governors for the islands is it not so,3
tell me the first thing that comes to your mind,3
really god i wouldnt know where to start and yet,3
i want you to tell me everything you remember father from the beginning everything,3
he never had one except aboard my ships,3
he asks when he can come to visit you he left his address,3

look out of that window,3
i am not afraid of you you are nothing but a dreamer,3
call them,3
all i have to do is call the guards,3
to rise so high in so short a time is a dangerous occupation a little hypocrisy goes a long way,3
what do i have so many already,3
you seem to have a special talent for making friends,3
good we are also in need of judges except there are no thieves,3
don bobadilla is already a judge my dear don cristobal,3
but we do have a lack of notaries you should contact my administration,3
for a commoner,3
you defend yourself admirably,3
forgive me don colon but what about gold,3
they dont see sin in their nakedness they live according to nature in a never ending summer the islands are covered with trees filled with blossoms and fruits and,3
if you wont accept our proposal well simply find someone who will,3
and were you never ambitious excellency or is ambition only a virtue among the nobles a fault for the rest of us,3
then you are too ambitious,3
im not bargaining,3
i remind you senor colon that you are in no position to bargain with me,3
no i have waited too long fought too hard now you expect me to take all the risks while you take the profit no i will not be your servant,3
no,3
no,3
you never learned how to speak my language,3
utapan wont you speak to me you used to know how to speak to me,3
you did the same to your god,3
you have to find them utapan look what they did,3
ask him if he will help,3

you are bound by an oath father,3
my son my son your certitudes are sometimes frightening christopher you must speak to them and if you dont i will,3
if i tell them they wont follow me you know that i am right father you trust me,3
may god forgive you you must tell them you must tell your men,3
i am not sure it could be twice the distance,3

i lied the journey will be longer than i said,3
what are you saying,3

i am listening my son,3

you mustnt give way to despair you must wait,3
only god knows the meaning of such words my son,3

passion is something one cannot control,3
father marchena,3

whyd you help me back there with the chief whyd you stand up for me like that,3
how you go out on a limb for somebody is by giving her a number of an immigration lawyer here heres a number of an immigration lawyer thats how you help her but you cant get involved in her like that youre gonna jeopardize your career your life and youre gonna jeopardize my case and lemme give you another piece of advice maybe you dont watch tv but ill let you in on a little secret the whole fuckin world watches television and when you get out there they know your face and the little fame the little fuckin itty bitty fame that i get in this city makes it a lot easier for my job and i get more done because of it,3
but i mean didnt you ever go out on a limb for somebody i mean you shoulda heard her there tellin her whole storyi believed her,3
well its not up to you to decide whether shes innocent or not dont you understand thats why youre a professional,3
i told you you know i thought i was doing the right thing you know i think shes innocent,3
no i dont think you were a fool i just think you were stupid about it i mean to say the least you outta know better you dont know her well enough shes got the potential to fucking hang you even if she suggests that you made a pass at her its fuckin over you can deny it all you want but it will not make one fucking bit of difference youre dead,3
yeah just her in the shower nothing happened look im sure you probably think im a fool and i fucked up but,3
just a shower,3
i took her there for a shower and thats it,3
well you shoulda because nobodys gonna believe you didntincluding me,3
look eddie im tellin you i didnt touch her,3
women like that have a way of turning professionals into amateurs,3
hey im a professional,3
okay tell you what ill give you a head start you take her to the station house dont let her out of your sight shes the only warm body we got left,3
you know what im saying here,3
youre her savior is she the kid youre gonna save from the burning building,3
cmon you intimidate her cause youre a celebrity she sees me differently,3
so am i,3
im serious here,3
my point exactly,3
i dont have a girlfriend,3

yeah,3
you wanna talk to her alone,3
look let me talk to her any leads i get theyre all yours just let me have a first crack at her,3
raw deal,3
shes fucked even if that story is true,3
something back home,3
why not,3
is that all there is,3
she just saw two of her friends killed they probably threatened her,3
what are you hiding why are you afraid,3
then i guess were doin this the right way arent we if we pull up to a burning building ill gladly let you go first,3
i wanted to run up to a building on fire kick in the door rush into the smoke and save a kid,3
hey i always wanted to be a cop when i was a kid i dreamed of running up to a door kicking it in pulling my gun and yelling freeze at the bad guy whatd you dream about,3

there wasnt a fire therell be nothing for you to do,3
ill come with you,3
or czechoslovakia the slavs have been fighting the germans and the russians for a thousand years these are very intense people and they take things personally,3
eastern europe like what romania hungary,3
maybe its a ritual thing or someone trying to send a message burial rites are taken very seriously in eastern europe it could be to humiliate them just burning them up no proper funeral its like condemning them to hell,3
look im not even sure she has anything to do with this i saw her outside after the fire thought it was a lead maybe she saw something maybe she was visiting somebody here who knows,3
what would you call her,3
who says shes a suspect,3
maybe you dont care about that either prettiest suspect ive had in awhile,3
hmmmm,3
pretty,3
the super said hed seen her before but she didnt live here,3
you were right they were both dead before the fire the male was stabbed so hard the killer broke off the tip of the knife in his spine thats usually an indicator of something personal,3
if you found me steppin on your crime scene it might piss you off too what about the report,3

the clerk,3
capra thats not czech or russian who said he sounded russian,3
room was registered to a francis capra,3
that doesnt apply to me because im not a criminal im not a criminal i wasnt convicted,3
but doesnt the son of sam law prevent criminals from profiting from their crimes,3
were in negotiations thats correct,3
and isnt there a movie in the works about you,3
look im in here you call this a career move,3
permanently disrupted arent you selling paintings now for quite a lot of money hasnt this incident as you call it jump started your career as an artist,3
look im a victim here too i was a year away from getting my masters in art now ill never graduate my life has been permanently disrupted,3
you seem very savvy for a man whos been found mentally incompetent to stand trial,3
it was my finger that pulled the trigger but im not morally responsible my psychiatrist knew what i was capable of how could i know im not a doctor,3
so you feel absolutely no responsibility for killing these people,3
yes my psychiatrist didnt insist that i stay on my medication,3
your doctor,3
this had nothing to do with shoes that didnt fit or my relationship with my father who as you know made a fortune selling penny loafers in the fifties these people died because of the criminal actions of my doctor,3
were trying to get there i hope we can,3
continued,3
im sorry dr smyslov but im really not at liberty to discuss this,3
continued,3
how did they manage to do that without any communication,3
continued,3
well i suppose theyve been having a bit of trouble with some of the equipment,3
continued,3
shes wonderful,3
continued,3
im afraid ive only got a few minutes but id love to,3
continued,3
well how nice to see you again elena youre looking wonderful,3
space stattion 5 lounge,3
roger,3
i think ill have to go out and burn them off,3
i guess not,3
i guess you dont know your own strength old boy,3
i didnt do that frank i took particular care not to freeze them,3
well now that weve got one thats actually failed we should be able to figure out whats happened and fix it,3
its the last one,3
yes,3
hal,3
well i hope theres nothing wrong with the assembly on those other wise were out of business,3
two more,3
two units in four days how many spares do we have,3
i dont know hal said he thought it might be the assembly procedure,3
no,3
youre kidding,3
well hals reported the aounit about to fail again,3
oh im fine im wide awake whats up,3
are you reasonably awake,3
good morning hows it going,3
anyway its just as well that we replace it better safe than sorry,3
yes but its more likely that the tolerances on our testing gear are too low,3
i suppose computers have been known to be wrong,3
yes i dont know what to make of it,3
well thats something,3
still all we have to do is ask hal,3
i guess it isnt,3
i suppose it isnt logically impossible,3
but not completely inconceivable,3
i know it would be almost inconceivable,3
yes but its to fantastic to think that theyd keep something from us,3
not really though it is strange when you think about it it didnt really make any sense to keep us apart during training,3
thats true,3
just ask hal its conceivable they might keep something from us but theyd never keep anything from hal,3
how,3
of course it would be very easy for us to find out now,3
yes i thought so,3
that seems very unlikely,3
i dont know all i heard is that theres something about the mission we werent told,3
oh well apparently theres something about the mission that the sleeping beauties know that we dont know and thats why we were trained separately and thats why they were put to sleep before they were even taken aboard,3
no as a matter of fact i didnt,3
yes you must have heard the rumour that went around during orbital checkout,3
oh,3
i suppose so though of course theres a more sinister explanation,3
i suppose the idea was specialized training,3
no i never did either,3
i must say i never did understand why they split us into two groups for training,3
i dont think we should make any fuss about it yet im sure theyll straighten it out,3
well what do you think we ought to do about it,3
its possible,3
not really they just said it might be because we trained at houston and they trained in marshall and that were being charged against differ ent accounting offices,3
yesterday i finally called the accounting office at mission control and all they could tell me was that theyd received the ags19 notification for the other three but not mine and apparently not yours either,3
yes,3
really,3
interesting that you mention it because ive got the same problem,3
thats right well naturally i didnt say anything to payroll i assumed theyd start paying me at the higher grade on the next pay cheque but its been almost three weeks now and im still being paid as an ags18,3
well i got the papers on my official upgrading to ags19 two weeks before we left,3
yes,3
its about my salary cheques,3
whats up,3
well its nothing really important but its annoying,3
sure what is it,3
dave if youve a minute id like your advice on something,3
okay come on down,3
okay,3
right just a sec,3
hi frank coming in please,3
listen to me very carefully hal unless you immediately release the hibernation control and follow every order i give from this point on i will immediately got to control central and carry out a complete disconnection,3
i know that youve had that on your mind for some time now dave but it would be a crying shame since i am so much more capable of carrying out this mission than you are and i have such enthusiasm and confi dence in the mission,3
i am prepared to do that anyway,3
hal unless you follow my instructions i shall be forced to disconnect you,3
im sorry dave but in accordance with subroutine c15324 quote when the crew are dead or incapacitated the computer must assume control unquote i must therefore override your authority now since you are not in any condition to intel ligently exercise it,3
hal im in command of this ship i order you to release the manual hibernation control,3
i can tell from the tone of your voice dave that youre upset why dont you take a stress pill and get some rest,3
i dont like to assert myself dave but it would be much better now for you to rest youve been involved in a very stressful situation,3
hal switch to manual hibernation control,3
look dave yourve probably got a lot to do i suggest you leave it to me,3
im goin to do this myself hal let me have the control please,3
if youre determined to revive the crew now i can handle the whole thing myself theres no need for you to trouble,3
i dont really agree with you dave my onboard memory store is more than capable of handling all the mission requirements,3
it doesnt have to be hal its more dangerous to be out of touch with earth let me have manual control please,3
repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation,3
the antenna has to be replaced,3
i suppose its because youve been under a lot of stress but have you forgotten that theyre not supposed to be revived for another three months,3
i suppose youre pretty broken up about it,3
yes it is,3
too bad about frank isnt it,3
well thats a relief you know i have the greatest enthusiasm possible for the mission,3
yes it is hal,3
is your confidence in me fully restored,3
and dont you worry about it,3
well dont worry about it,3
im sorry about the misunderstanding hal,3
naturally dave im not pleased that the aounit has failed but i hope at least this has restored your confidence in my integrity and reliability i certainly wouldnt want to be disconnected even temporarily as i have never been disconnected in my entire service history,3
okay hal well lets see the way things go from here on,3
look dave i know that youre sincere and that youre trying to do a competent job and that youre trying to be helpful but i can assure the problem is with the aounits and with your test gear,3
hal is there anything bothering you anything that might account for this problem,3
im not questioning your word dave but its just not possible im not capable of being wrong,3
yes i know that but i can assure you that they were about to fail,3
you probably also know that we found them okay,3
yes i know,3
you know that we checked the two aounits that you reported in imminent failure condition,3
sure dave whats up,3
not now hal id like to talk to you about something,3
i understand hal well take care of it please let me have the hard copy,3
the unit is still operational dave but it will fail within seventytwo hours,3
my fpc shows an impending failure of the antenna orientation unit,3
what is it hal,3
sorry to interrupt the festivities dave but i think weve got a problem,3
hes got a point,3
im sorry frank but i dont think i can answer that question without knowing everything that all of you know,3
well the only important aspect of the mission are where are we going what will we do when we get there when are we coming back and why are we going,3
continued,3
still you really dont believe it do you,3
continued,3
well its silly but if you want to why dont you,3
coninued,3
well what is it,3
continued,3
did they have any explanation for this,3
continued,3
yes i remember you mentioning it i got mine about the same time,3
continued,3
goodbye daddy,3
bye bye now sweetheart,3
yes daddy,3
ill wish you a happy birthday now and ill see you soon all right darling,3
thank you daddy,3
okay sweetheart have a lovely birthday party tomorrow,3
three darling one two three be sure to tell mommy i called,3
how many days until you come home,3
okay sweetheart well i have to go now tell mommy that i called,3
shes in the bathroom,3
where is mrs brown,3
mommys out to the hair dresser,3
one two three can i speak to mommy,3
in three days darling i hope,3
when are you coming home,3
no im sorry darling i told you i wont be home for a few days,3
are you coming to my party,3
yes i know that sweetheart,3
im having a party tomorrow,3
im fine daddy when are you coming home,3
im at space station five darling how are you,3
ill bet its a fortune,3
i was working out what this trip must cost taking him up there by himself and coming back empty,3
yes well whatever it is theyre certainly not fooling around this is the first flight they allowed in for more than a week,3
berkeley told me that they think it came from contamination on a returning mars flight,3
i suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later,3
well ive heard more and more people talk of an epidemic,3
well hows it going back there,3
thank you,3
oh thank you very much,3
thank you its been a great pleasure to meet all of you dr smyslov,3
well gregor and i will look forward to seeing you,3
well i hope that you and your wife can come to the iac conference in june,3
no thank you and im afraid now i really must be going,3
are you sure you wont change your mind about a drink,3
well that does sound very odd,3
clavius control came on the air just long enough to transmit their refusal,3
well where are all of you off to,3
hes fine but im afraid we dont get a chance to see each other very much these days,3
how is gregor,3
oh thats such a delightful age,3
oh shes growing up very fast as a matter of fact shes six tomorrow,3
and your charming little daughter,3
yes its coming along very well,3
i suppose you saw the work on our new section while you were docking,3
yes i think so just about then,3
fine,3
well shall we go through documentation,3
yes very pleasant,3
well did you have a pleaant flight,3
please it really doesnt matter,3
well thank you very much for being so understanding,3
im terribly sorry i was just on my way down to meet you i saw your ship dock and i knew i had plenty of time and i was on my way out of the office when suddenly the phone rang,3
how do you do mr miller,3
dr smyslov im not permitted to discuss this,3
this epidemic could easily spread to our base dr floyd we should be given all the facts,3
quite frankly we have had some very reliable intelligence reports that a quite serious epidemic has broken out at clavius something apperently of an unknown origin is this in fact what has happened,3
certainly,3
dr floyd at the risk of pressing you on a point you seem reticent to discuss may i ask you a straightforward question,3
well im glad about that,3
fortunately they did,3
yes well i hope the crew got back safely,3
yes and im afaid theres going to be a bit of a row about it denying the men permission to land was a direct violation of the ias convention,3
i see,3
thats right,3
you mean you havent been able to get anyone at the base for ten days,3
yes well at first we thought that was the explanation but its been going on for the past ten days,3
yes well for one thing whenever you phone the base all you can get is a recording which repeats that the phone lines are temporarily out of order,3
really,3
well its just for the past two weeks there have been some extremely odd things happening at clavius,3
im sorry but im not sure i know what you mean,3
yesas a matter of fact i am,3
are you by any chance going up to your base at clavius,3
well as it happens im on my way up to the moon,3
yes really thank you very much,3
are you quite sure,3
oh i really dont have time for a drink if its all right ill just sit for a minute and then ive got to be off,3
i dont think it has but id like to check that simpson whats the log on that,3
has it been exposed to any sun before now,3
well not really at first glance black would suggest something sunpowered but then why would anyone deliberately bury a sun powered device,3
any ideas about the colour,3
tomb shine surveymarker spare part take your choice,3
but you dont have any idea as to what it is,3
not really its completely inert no sound or energy sources have been detected the surface is made of something incredibly hard and weve been barely able to scratch it a laser drill,3
any clue as to what it is,3
by the deformation between the mother rock and the fill,3
how can you tell it was deliberately buried,3
yes it does the subsurface structure shows that it was deliberately buried about four million years ago,3
im afraid it can and it will be kept under wraps as long as it is deemed to be necessary by the council and of course you know that the council has requested that formal security oaths are to be obtained in writing from every one who had any knowledge of this event there must be adequate time for a full study to be made of the situation before any con sideration can be given to making a public announcement,3
dr floyd how long do you think this can be kept under wraps,3
well thank you very much and please let us know if there is anything we can do to make your trip more comfortable,3
no of course captain i can understand your concern,3
well fine thanks very much anyway and i hope you dont mind me asking,3
yes well i wouldnt have been too concerned about it except ive heard these stories about the epidemic and as a matter of fact ive heard that ten people have died already,3
i see well im sorry about that i wouldnt think theres any cause for alarm,3
well ill tell you why i ask you see ive got a girl who works in the auditing department of the territorial administrator and i havent been able to get her on the phone for the past week or so and with all these stories one hears im a little concerned about her,3
i take it this is something to do with the trouble theyre having up at clavius,3
i see,3
well the crew is confined to the ship when we land at clavius we have to stay inside for the time it take to refit about twentyfour hours and then were going to back empty,3
what do you mean,3
incidentally dr floyd i wonder if i can have a word with you about the security arrangements,3
thank you,3
oh no thank you the two girls have taken wonderful care of me im just fine,3
were scheduled to dock in about seven hours is there anything we can do for you,3
when do we arrive at clavius,3
theres nothing like weightless sleep for a complete rest,3
oh marvellous its the first real sleep ive had for the past two days,3
all right hal well take care of it let me have the hard copy please,3
not really frank i think there may be a flaw in the assembly procedure,3
do you have any idea of what is causing this fault,3
let me see the tracking alignment display,3
i know you did frank but i assure you there was an impending failure,3
it looks like we have another bad ao unit my fpc shows another impending failure,3
yes hal whats up,3
opening pod bay doors,3
pod bay is decompressed all doors are secure you are free to open pod bay doors,3
hal check all airlock doors secure,3
roger,3
hal maintain normal eva condition,3
i understand,3
hal im going out now to replace the ao unit,3
five by five frank,3
roger,3
hal have pod arms secure the component,3
thank you very much hal,3
thats true,3

hey howd my car get here,3
yeah it missed the last four stops,3
notice something funny about that bus,3
luthers on the move,3
why,3
when you been in prison three years it dont take long lets go,3
that was quick,3
i can just take her right across the street to luthers hotel all i need is some money for the room,3
yeah i see her,3
yeah guess not,3
bein good at your job dont explain everything jack,3
thanks for callin in and i guess maybe look im sorry i called you watermellon nigger those kinds of things i was just leanin on ya doin my job,3
you sure thats the reason,3
i dont know why but im going to let you keep it maybe because you told me you had it or maybe just because im too tired to argue,3
forget it i want ganz as bad as you do and i got some other news for you,3
tell me something why didnt you just take the money off luther and split,3
so you took the rest of the night off,3
they must have set up a meeting for the morning luther left an 8 am wakeup and put up the dont disturb sign hes trading his girl for the money all we have to do to grab ganz is not go blind,3
let him get some sleep hes going to need it,3
maybe we should pay luther a visit,3
you missed luther took a taxi to the hotel across the street made a phone call,3
we missed,3
what about ganz,3
what about luther,3
hello and goodbye,3
be polite say hello this is candy,3
wheres luther,3
ill be there in a minute you dont move your ass right,3
hey jack how ya doin what took you so long to call man i been waitin im at vromans up in the fillmore yeah vromans course you dont hang out here its for the brothers,3
no way,3
you stay with me,3
bullshit then im staying with the money,3
right if you ever switch from armed robbery to pimping then youre all set,3
that was in style a couple years back man,3
yeah most cops are pretty dumb but since youre the one that landed in jail whats that make you,3
were getting too close cates whats the matter you been takin dumb pills,3
class isnt somethin you buy punk look at you five hundred dollar suit and youre still a lowlife,3
no class,3
what you dont understand is i dont give a damn about how this thing looks,3
you know id be embarrassed if i let my wheels go the way youve done with this job,3
yeah it doesnt look like hes gonna make it as a dangerous tough guy,3
a long time agb luther must of got the shit beat out of him so bad it just rattled his brain that would account for him making so many wrong moves in a row,3
if hes hoping that then hes dumber than i think he is which would be amazin cause i already think hes real dumb,3
maybe luther hopes ganzll give him a piece of your money,3
you got a very depressing view of life man you gotta smile once in awhile,3
im not in this cause its fun im not into hitting guys cause it makes me feel good either i do it cause it works,3
doesnt it get tiring,3
if they dont tell me what i need to know,3
say do you always work people over like you did luther,3
that aint philosophy thats common sense,3
i let women get to me the quest for pussy is the meaning of life i got my own personal philosophy about em keep women separate from guns money and business women are for spending money they got nothing to do with helping you make it,2
i suppose youd never be like luther and let a woman get to you,3
oh yeah does bein in love make you stupid,3
im tellin you the mans in love he wants to be a hero for his girl,3
if i was his size and had ganz on my ass id just leave town,3
tryin to save his girl man hes in another world,3
youd think the guyd be smart enough to know he was being tailed,3
i had no choice some white asshole bought the last piece of shit skyblue cadillac,3
didnt know you darker people went in for foreign jobs,3
jesus christ look at all the dust on my carwhy in the hell dont he take it to a car wash,3
jesus christ thats a disgrace the guy pulls a gun on a cop and hes out in 24 hours i tell you some of the courts these days are just a fucking revolving door,3
musta got some primo bondsman,3
what,3
guess what luther just got in line,3
not really i figured ganz was put down for a long time and i knew luther would never job me on his own hes too chickenshit,3
you took a big chance leaving this here all this time,3
shit,3
i wasnt sure the money was still there until we saw luther you almost got your ass shot off for nothing once not twice jack,3
you son of a bitch you knew where the money was all along and all we had to do was come here and wait i almost got my ass blown off twice tonight for nothing,3
you just drove by it,3
for three years lets hope it wasnt a towaway zone,3
thisll show you how smart i am i got it parked,3
youre a real case you know that jack,3
wheres the goddamn car,3
yeah right,3
get this we aint partners we aint brothers we aint friends if ganz gets away with my money youre gonna be sorry we ever met,3
right partner,3
in the trunk of a car a lot better than under a mattress right,3
wheres the money,3
depends on how things work out i believe in the merit system so far you havent built up any points,3
you gonna let me keep any of it,3
not likely convict,3
we split 5050,3
you catch on real fastokay jack lets talk deal how much of my money you gonna let me keep,3
hes after your money,3
me and my bunch hit a dealer in the middle of a sale its the kind of money nobody ever reports stolen i was sittin pretty livin in the high cotton then somebody fingered me for another job some psycho whos out there capping people with some cops gun,3
just tell me about the money,3
jesus,3
half a million,3
how much,3
i been waiting a long time for some money,3
one things for sure jack thats how youll tell the story,3
they saved your ass convict,3
naw youd just call your pals back to bail you out one more time,3
yeah right you want to try again,3
who gives a goddamn what you think youre just a crook thats got a weekendpass youre not even a name anymore just a spear chucker with a goddamn number stenciled on the back of his prison fatigues,3
maybe i dont like the way you ask,3
luther knew more than he told me and so do younow you better tell we what the fuck this is all about i gave you 48 hours to come up with something and the clocks runnin,3
im impressed with you too jack you did a real good job of busting up a couple of dykes bedded down for the night,3
you dont make me laugh you cant take care of shit youve been dicking me around since we started on this turdhunt all youre good for is games so far what i got outta you is nothin,3
you wanna leave man let me take care of ganz all by myself,3

yeah it bothers me when cops get hurt while im makin a play i dont like it,3
anthing botherin you besides losin your gun,3
yeah,3
jack come on there is an official department policy about cop killings cop killers represent a special priority because any man crazy enough to kill a cop is a greater threat to an unarmed civilian in other words we cant seen like were in the revenge business i know we all know the truths a little different,3
hey the bastards got my gun i want it back,3
yeah i read the report,3
i want to be left alone on this one algren was killed with my gun,3
i guess when two cops die on account of your fuck up you want to keep it as quiet as possible,3

somebody steals your gun youre supposed to file a report,3
the truth hurts doesnt it buddy,3

so what,3
it might pay to reexamine a few of your more primitive notions i was in bed with a girlfriend watching tv last week jack and one thing we know about me is i happen not to be a lesbian now if this indians girlfriend got upset when you came looking for him it could just be shes still vulnerable to him,3

cornilius,3
appipulai leeloo minai,3
i know,3
you are a monster zorg,3
let me reassure you fatheri will never kill more people in my entire life than religion has killed in the last 2000 years,3
destroying a glass is one thingkilling people with the weapons you produce is quite another,3
father by creating a little destruction i am in fact encouraging life so in reality you and i are in the same business,3
they are robots,3
look at all these little things so busy all of a sudden notice how each one is useful what a lovely ballet so full of form and color so full oflife,3
follow me life which you so nobly serve comes from destruction look at this empty glass,3
no thank you,3
would you like a drink,3
ah father you are so wrong let me explain,3
im a priest im here to serve life all you want to do is destroy it,3
why whats wrong with me,3
even it i did know where the stones were i would never tell somebody like you,3
personally they are of no interest to me id rather sell weaponsbut i have a customer so tell me,3
why on earth do the stones interest you,3
im glad you got your memory back father because youre going to need it where are the stones,3
i remember you nowthe so called art dealer,3
zorg jeanbaptiste emmanuel zorg nice to see you again,3
im fucked,3
were saved,3
thats what im saying,3
and you dont know how they open is that what you are saying,3
yes of course but the stones are shut they have to be open for it to work,3
theres no light you told me there were supposed to be four beams of light,3
theoretically yes the four stones form the beam and the fifth element is supposed to stand in the middle there but i dont have the reference book ive never seen the stones work,3
dont tell me you dont know how all this works,3
uh have you tried the divas suite,3
when is she not in trouble,3
leeloos in trouble,3
yeah i know to save the world but right now all i want to do is save leeloo,3
youre probably very angry with me and i quite understand but i want you to know im fighting for a noble cause,3
trying to save your ass so you can save the world,3
what are you doing,3
father i was in the army for awhile and every time they told us we were on a mission to save the world the only thing that changed was i lost a lot of friends so thanks for the offer but no thanks,3
of course,3
good luck,3
we have to save the world,3
what kind of mission,3
were not going on vacationwere on a mission,3
is that the usual way priests go on vacation,3
im sorry to have to resort to such methods but we heard about your good luck on he radio and we need the tickets to fhloston,3
thats what i thought,3
it means never without my permission,3
excuse me just one thing she said something to me a while ago and i dont really get it akta gamat,3
i know i was there when she arrived,3
shes fine reallydont you worry just needs some restshes had a very long trip,3

shes an exception,3

so you do know her,3
theres not a moment to lose wake her up but be gentle about it this woman is mankinds most precious possession she is perfect,3
you noticed,3
hes a she,3
the girl,3
i brought the girl remember,3
who are you,3
she dropped in on me holding this,3
thats me but i dont know who she is where did you find her,3
shes not my bride shes my fare shes looking for this vito cornelius according to the phone guide he lives here,3
weddings are one floor down congratulations,3

white turns to black light to dark life to death for all eternity,3
but what happens if instead of this ultimate warrior it is evil who stands here,3
yesthank god,3
is there anything that can stop it,3
and then it will be too late the goal of evil is to wipe out life all forms of life for all eternitylife upsets it,3
and then,3
we have fortyeight hours the time it needs to adapt itself to our living conditions,3
thats exactly what we are going to try and do protect the lives of some 200 billion of our fellow citizens general you may fire when ready,3
time is of no importance mr president only life is important,3
your theory is interesting father but i dont think we have time to go into it right now,3
one more reason to shoot first eh,3
imagine for a moment that this thing is not anything that can be identified because it prefers not to be because it is the antithesis of all we are because it is evil total evil,3
later david later theres not a minute to lose,3
youre all safe thanks be to god,3
its all my fault im the servant its my mission here,3
on the plane with mr dallas the real one,3

they really made her,3
i didnt know your size,3
there was this guy with a limp who came a month agosaid he was an art dealer asking all these questions about the sacred stonesat the time i didnt think anything of it what was his name im so bad with names,3
yes of course,3

i dont have time i need to know,3
i i dont know we hardly know each other it takes time,3
do you love her,3
ill help her i promise but i think you should tell me where the stones are,3
she was taught to love the life of others but not her own you have to teach her to love if you want her to truly live,3
so cornelius was telling the truth,3
yes and more than that you must give her the stones shes the only one who knows how to use them,3

ill consider it,3
i want to watch you work,3

put the gun down take the handcuffs handcuff yourself to the bed,3
is that him,3
its good what youre doing,3
youre gonna be seeing a lot of me youre sure you dont mind,3
its horrible but itll be your best friend after a few days i hope you realize what kind of long shot youre chasing after,3
any good,3
files are mostly by state and year of disappearance we try to keep the children and adults separate no eating or smoking in here but theres a coffee machine in the hall,3
well thats all i can do sorry,3
they were pretty clear they didnt want this coming back on them,3
i can give you my card if your clients want to call me,3
theyre putting themselves in place of this kids parents and thinking theyd want to hear their girls okay even if thats all they hear,3
im not so sure about this,3
this doctor and wife theyre nice people but they dont want to get too involved theyre not trying to have the parents come looking for the girl either you and i both know sometimes not often but sometimes theres real reasons why a kidll run molestation whatever besides that the girls probably eighteen so shes legal,3
why dont they come to me,3
for whatever reasons i thought you might be more receptive,3
we do,3
i figured you share information,3
why not go to the ncic or ncmec,3
few days ago i was contacted by a couple living in philadelphia a doctor and his wife what happened was they picked up a young girl hitchhiking off 81 which heads into philadelphia started up a conversation with this girl she looked homeless seemed about eighteen maybe they convinced her to let them buy her a meal in the city nice kid mature didnt have much to say but they got a sense shes a runaway so all through dinner the doctors working on her trying to convince her that at the very least she should pick up a telephone not surprisingly she ate her food excused herself thats the last they saw her the reason they came to me for help the reason im coming to you is we had a friend of mine in the department work up a sketch they want to see if i can id this girl somehow pass along a message to let the parents know the kids alive doing alright,3
absolutely of course ill abide by whatever decision you make but id appreciate if youll hear me out,3
there are reasons for the way we do things here,3
what id like very simply is access to your archive and now i understand this isnt something you normally do for private citizens,3
alright tom,3
call me tom,3
what can i do for you mr welles,3
what do you want you want me to fall to my knees and start crying like a baby,3
thats right you just stood there and watched because you felt like it almost makes you worse,3
i never killed anyone,3
easy enough for you,3
do it put me out of my misery so i dont have to listen to you whining anymore you think its so easy,3
dont think i wont,3
do it,3
i fucking dont know what do you think we werent burying treasure we didnt pace it out so we could come back and get it we dug a hole and we put her in it your guess is as good as mine,3
where show me where,3
i dont know out there somewhere,3

where do you think youre taking this huh gonna be a big hero avenge that little girls death gonna make everything right with the world how you gonna do that,3
keep moving,3
show me,3
took it out the bathroom window buried it in the woods,3
what did you do with her body,3
there wasnt nobody around this place was a shithole i backed up the car to the door and we carried her in like groceries dino made her eat a bunch of pills we laid out the plastic put film in the camera and machine went to work,3
nobody saw you bring her in,3
what do you want to know you saw it you saw the loop,3
tell me what happened,3
made me sick but what did i care what did i care if some hump wants to beat off to that it was just something i was doing for money,3
you enjoy it,3
i dont know i felt like it i never saw anyone get done before,3
because were going there,3
why,3
show me where you did it on the map exactly where you did it,3
fuck you then you want to know i talked her up told her how beautiful she was told her she was gonna be a star i told her i was gonna get her a screen test and while im doing that i got her a soda and dropped a mickey when it was dark enough i rang dino and told him it was go time i put her in the trunk of my car and we went and we fucking did it thats what happened shes dead shes been dead a long fucking time nobody fucking cares,3
i want to know i want to know exactly what you did to her,3
what the fuck do you want from me,3
what did you do knock her out shoot her up,3
something like that,3
so you brought dino in and he brought machine and one day a girl walked into your office because you had an ad in the paper for models and she never walked out,3
it was a lot of fucking money,3
thats all thirty each thats all it took for you to murder her,3
thirty thousand each that fucking cocksucker,3
how much did he pay you,3
yeah,3
told him you could get him a snuff film,3
yeah the fucking lawyer,3
okay well come back to that so six years ago a guy contacts you through the classifieds over the phone however he does it its longdale looking for a snuff film and you entrepreneur that you are tell him you can hook him up,3
what the fuck am i gonna protect that freak for he was dinos boy not mine he shows up with his mask on leaves with his mask on nobody knows,3
i will never get tired of hurting you eddie so you might want to change your attitude,3
i told you i dont know,3

you killed that girl and you put it on film you and your pals youre fucked you fucked up real good,3
what the fuck are you,3
you murdered that girl eddie six years ago,3
who is this,3
i know what you did,3

i know what you did,3
yeah whos this,3
eddie,3
celebrity films,3
fuck you,3
get together some upscale product where the girls still have teeth in their head till then fuck you,3
look you cocksucker,3
the only thing wrong is the cheap softcore crap youre peddling eddie where do you get this stuff,3
maybe theres something wrong with the scumbag customers coming into your place ever think of that,3
i had three jerkoffs trying to return your tapes last month do you know how bad a skin flick has to be for some jackass to come back into my place with a fucking receipt and try to fucking return it,3
you know how my tapes sell people eat this stuff up,3
look at him you think he played it square how much did he give you how much did he keep for himself,3
hes lying,3
go ahead shoot me then try driving to brooklyn with my brains all over the windshield,3
give me the film,3
youll get it when we get there,3
give me the film,3
fuck you,3
you almost went over your limit,3
because he could he did it because he could what other reason were you looking for,3
enlighten me,3
isnt it incredibly obvious,3
why did he buy a film of some poor lost girl getting butchered,3
a man like mr christian a great man all his money all his power a man who attained everything there was to attain,3
im asking,3
youre asking me why,3
just tell me tell me some more of the secrets you and christian shared what kind of degenerate pervert was he really what the fuck did he want with a snuff film,3
youre making me very angry,3
did it get him off huh watching them cut her up tell me because i really want to understand did he jerk off to it you watch it with him sit there giving him a handjob while you both watched,3
shut your mouth and drive,3
mary anne mathews was alive till you paid money to have her murdered,3
shut up,3
you found these smut dealers and asked to buy a snuff film right wanted them to find you one well they didnt find you one longdale they went out and made you one,3
mary anne mathews that was her name her mom remembers her,3
none of this would be happening if you would have left it alone if you werent digging up a girl who died six years ago a girl no one even remembers,3
except youre willing commit murder with them,3
theyre no friends of mine,3
followed me must have freaked out when you saw me closing in on your buddies,3
never mind how i found you,3
thats why you got scared when mrs christian hired me you knew about the film figured it had to be in that safe howd you find me,3
i was well compensated,3
must have paid you a lot for you to risk everything wouldve had to have cut yourself a real nice piece of money,3
thats trust mr christian trusted me implicitly,3
so he sent you gave you the money his errandboy and if you refused it wasnt like you could tell anyone your pervert boss just asked you to get him a snuff film thats the beauty of lawyerclient privilege,3
wouldnt exactly have been possible for a man of his stature,3
you were the middleman am i right old man christian wasnt about to go shopping for a snuff film himself,3
well whatever reasons mrs christian has for engaging the services of a private investigator i should certainly be a party to but since she feels differently i can only go on the record as having expressed my adamant disapproval,3
thats right,3
you are a private investigator,3
of what sort,3
as mr christians attorney and one of the executors of his estate it concerns me that a meeting of this sort should take place without my being asked to attend,3
im listening,3
yes i do have something to say i insisted on being here as soon as i heard mrs christian contacted you,3
its not my money the woman i got it from is never going to give it a second thought lets not make a big deal out of this okay go be a race car driver go run for president whatever,3
look thats awful generous and everything,3
its money people use it to purchase goods and services,3
whats this,3
nope,3
still dont want to tell me what youre doing,3
im trying to figure that out myself i have to see machine without his mask,3
whats next,3
devil frightened me as much as it excited me but id be hard pressed to choose a favorite,3
i know if i had to pick itd be choke or devil,3
what kind of junior pi would i be if i didnt go with you,3
you dont need to be here,3
nobody knows his name thats his thing he always wears a mask you never see his face he calls himself machine thats what they call him machine,3
who is he his name,3
i told you hes one of dino velvets stock players,3
who is he,3
who is this in the mask who is he,3
wha,3
its cheap and people know to mind their own business what have you got for me,3
oh come on man what are we doing in this flea bag,3
great,3
its their presidential suite,3
you didnt say it was gonna be this luxurious,3
see ya,3
consider it meanwhile dig up whatever dino velvet films you can get receipts ill call back,3
you want me to come out there and play private eye,3
take a vacation ill pay you four hundred a day plus expenses,3
im a working stiff pops,3
well im in new york now what do you say to flying out and giving me a hand,3
he cuts all kinds of other stuff into his movies photographs newsreel footage subliminal images thinks hes making art,3
alright i get the picture,3
nothing illegal its always borderline like if some freak wants to see a transvestite in a full rubber immersion suit getting an enema from a,3
out of the back of bondage magazines mostly but you can find it on the street if you look hell also do commissions for enough money,3
where does he sell it,3
youre learning,3
specialty product,3
his stuff comes out of new york bondage and fetish videos gothic hardcore definitely not for the squeamish,2
films whod have thought it,3
flicks supposed to be a real weirdo,3
good question,3
so you have a wife and kid waiting for you in pennsylvania what are you doing mixed up in all this,3
a daughter,3
i see a ring on your finger you have any kids,3
what about me,3
you cant sit there all day watching the parade of losers that comes into that place without going numb so what am i gonna go off and be a race car driver go to harvard run for president what about you pops,3
youre telling me it doesnt get to you,3
yeah im a real genius what choices have i got fuck just because i know about stuff like tonight doesnt mean i deal it i work a job it beats pumping gas beats making hamburgers,3
you just strike me as smart enough to be doing something else,3
im not mixed up in anything hayseed what are you talking about,3
i dont mean any offense but what are you doing mixed up in all this,3
i dont know where are yours,3
where are your parents,3
twentyfive,3
how old are you,3
first of all basement sales like tonight arent gonna last much longer its too risky one and two everythings going on the internet anyone with a computer and enough patience can find anything he wants its heaven for those degenerate chickenhawks theyre swapping pictures back and forth as fast as their modems can zap em but theres still some weird shit under the counter where i work sometimes no one knows where it comes from thats local underground where information spreads by word of mouth those are zombies hardcore junkies their hands are permanently pruned they go out in the sun they dont burn they blister other than that all i know about is the mail classified ads in the paper with hidden codes secret couriers credit card orders to dummy corporations interstate wire transfers revolving po boxes but if youre asking me who do you go to to get illegal shit who knows thats the whole point the seller stays as far away from the buyer as possible and vice versa and cops cant trace the deal theres ways to do it so nobody knows who anybody is,3
what other ways are there to get illegal films who do you see,3
i heard you asking that guy wasnt yanking you around theres no such thing,3
snuff films,3
and bondage films they straddle the line how are you supposed to tell if the person tied up with the ball gag in their mouth is a consenting or not step over that line youre into kiddie porn rape films but there arent many ive never seen one,2
child pornography,3
what you saw tonight were not talking about a video some dentist takes home over the weekend were talking about stuff where people get hurt specialty product,3
interesting theory,3
youve got penthouse playboy hustler etc nobody even considers them pornography anymore then theres mainstream hardcore triple x the difference is penetration thats hardcore that whole industrys up in the valley writers directors porn stars theyre celebrities or they think they are they pump out 150 videos a week a week theyve even got a porno academy awards america loves pornography anybody tells you they never use pornography theyre lying somebodys buying those videos somebodys out there spending 900 million dollars a year on phone sex know what else its only gonna get worse more and more youll see perverse hardcore coming into the mainstream because thats evolution desensitization oh my god elvis presleys wiggling his hips how offensive nowadays mtvs showing girls dancing around in thong bikinis with their asses hanging out know what i mean for the pornaddict big tits arent big enough after a while they have to be the biggest tits ever some porn chicks are putting in breast implants bigger than your head literally soon playboy is gonna be penthouse penthousell be hustler hustlerll be hardcore and hardcore filmsll be medical films peoplell be jerking off to women laying around with open wounds theres nowhere else for it to go,2

i dont know what youre looking for mister but so were clear from the start im straight,3
thomas welles nice picture,3
i need some information thought you might be able to help,3
came back for that batteryoperated vagina right told you you would,2
remember me,3
might get drummed out of the pornographers union and then where would i be,3
wouldnt want to embarrass yourself in front of your fellow perverts,3
i tear off the cover and paste this one on you know how it is,3
truman capote,3
catchy title what are you really reading hard to believe that books got any parts worth highlighting,3
once you pick it up you cant put it down,3
ill risk it,3
its your call but youre gonna be sorry when youre in one of those everyday situations that call for a batteryoperated vagina and you dont have one,2
well its tempting but no thanks,3
my boss tells me i have to do more suggestive selling,3
pardon me,3
can i interest you in a battery operatedvagina,3
yeah guess so,3
big date tonight,3
if you have a pencil and paper ill tell you how to send it,3
how will i get it to you,3
ive got about five thousand left in cash but ill need another thirty if you approve,3
fine,3
ive made progress im in manhattan once a few more pieces fall into place ill drive to you and give you an update,3
nothing more than a bother have you any news for me,3
i hope its nothing serious,3
ive been ordered into bed the doctor says ive gotten the flu or some other wretched ailment,3
i dont know if lucks the word are you feeling alright,3
how are you having any luck,3
mrs christian tom welles here,3
hello,3
youre one hell of a detective mrs christian,3
you told me to look so i looked,3
send it to me through the post office like we arranged no return address you dug this up all by yourself,3
okay,3
for a human life murder on film no statute of limitations who knows it sure could have id like you to overnight me a copy of those checks then put them in a safe deposit box,3
do you think the film could have cost that much,3
im here,3
hello,3
to the penny exactly one million dollars in cash,3
youre joking,3
totalled together these five checks from five different accounts they equal one million dollars,3
okay i follow you so far,3
one was for two hundred thousand one dollar and thirteen cents another was for three hundred thousand six hundred fifty four dollars and seventy six cents,3
the checks were for odd amounts,3
im not positive this means anything,3
my husband never dealt with money personally certainly not cash,3
okay,3
i know what im asking your compensation will be appropriate to the risk youll need cash to buy information and ill provide it i feel responsible mr welles you saw what he did to her,3
nothing remotely like this,3
youve found missing persons before,3
i deal in divorce cases corporate investigations,3
any evidence you collect can be given to the police later anonymously ive thought about it and theres no other way if you cant find them if the only thing that comes from this film is that this is all my husband will be remembered for well i cant let that happen im telling you i wont if theres no chance that poor girls memory can be served then ill just have to spend my last days trying to forget her,3
it wont work like that,3
no for me to live with the ruin of my husbands name i need know that whoever did this will be punished if you can find them i will take their names to the police ill say my husband confessed on his death bed ill say i didnt have courage to come forward at first,3
you dont have any other choice,3
i told you i cant not yet,3
you you need to go to the police,3
of course but im certain its nothing to worry about,3
will you watch it and see for yourself,3
im sure it is its probably something your husband was given as a bad joke more than likely he never even watched it,3
im telling you its not that,3
if you were to study it youd see the camera cutting away youd see the tricks they can play,3
no,3
please believe me this is probably a stag film simulated rape hard to stomach and it might seem real but there are ways of making it look realistic fake blood and special effects,2
mrs christian please will you sit down a moment i want you to listen carefully what youre talking about is a snuff film but from what i know snuff films are a kind of urban myth like red light district folklore theres no such thing i can assure you,3
i didnt know what to think i cant tell you how horrible its been to know this belonged to my husband to know that he watched this this atrocity but i cant go to the police,3
this is a movie showing a girl being murdered shes sitting on a bed and a man rapes her and he begins to cut her with a knife i only watched what i could,3
im afraid i dont,3
its a film of a girl being murdered,3
cash stock certificates and this,3
do you want to tell me what you found,3
there was nothing he could do my husband left everything to me i prevented anyone from seeing the contents i felt these were my husbands private things i didnt i didnt realize,3
you hired someone to open it ill bet the lawyer loved that,3
my husband was the only one with the combination to this safe i knew about it but as far as i was concerned it was none of my business not till now that is,3
just curious,3
i wear a gun when i can tell a client expects me to other than that theres never any reason,3
do you carry a gun mr welles,3
we were married fortyfive years hard even for me to imagine we had our troubles there were plenty of places for him to be other than here but he was always loyal to me and i to him i loved him deeply,3
he succeeded,3
mostly thats where he started his empire building he was a good man notorious as an eccentric but that was something he cultivated he wanted to be legendary,3
pittsburgh,3
ill do whatever i can to help,3
his passing has left me with something of a dilemma a terrible terrible dilemma,3
my condolences,3
as you know my husband passed away recently two weeks ago now,3
you are highly recommended praised for your discretion your strict adherence to confidentiality,3
ive been privileged to provide services for people i admire,3
ive spoken to friends of mine and my husbands in harrisburg in lancaster and hershey asking about you i must say you have friends in influential places,3
hes a lawyer please sit here,3
hes odd,3
thank you,3
have a pleasant evening will you have tea mister welles,3
apparently mr longdale has something he feels he simply must say before you and i speak,3
uh huh pleasure,3
i try to be,3
mister welles youre very prompt,3
they murdered her mrs mathews im sorry it happened a month after she ran away shes been dead all this time,3
why why are you doing this to me,3
they killed her and they took her out in the forest somewhere and they buried her,3
no no no,3
he raped her andandand he murdered herhe cut her up with knifes,3

they brought her into the room one man he put a knife to her throat and he raped her,3
who are you,3

who is this,3
mrs mathews your daughter is dead shes dead,3
what,3
she went to california to los angeles she wanted to start over she wanted to be an actress,3
what are you talking about,3
i have to tell you something it wont be easy for you to hear its about your daughter mary anne when i when i was there with you her diary in your attic in silverware if you read it youll know what im telling you is true,3
i remember you just left,3
mrs mathews its thomas do you remember i was there a few weeks ago asking about your daughter,3
hello,3
what am i supposed to do forget her time heals all wounds right shes all i think about and ive learned to live with that but you want the truth the real truth if i had a choice if i had to choose between her being out there living a good life and being happy and me not knowing never finding out what happened to her or her being dead and me knowing id choose to know,3
its been six years,3
i think about it everyday but every time the phone rings every single time i still think its her,3
yes,3
you were right i didnt find anything im going to run and get something to eat are you hungry,3
youre probably right and i probably wont find anything i dont have a right to ask this and you can kick me out of your house if you want but this is my profession and theres a part of me that cant let it go police are just as human as you or i they could have missed something they probably didnt wouldnt you rather know,3
my husband never laid a hand on her she would have told me she would have told me,3
will you let me look,3
how how can you say that to me,3
if the police focused their search in her room her belongings well thatd be only natural but they may have been looking in the wrong place,3
no you dont have any reason to think that,3
it is possible and i know this isnt something you want to hear your daughter may have tried to hide a note where she thought you would eventually find it but where she knew your husband would never find it she might have wanted to tell you something,3
i dont know i think so,3
do you think the police did a good job,3
there wasnt one the police looked,3
its not really my place but its not easy for me to set aside the private detective part of me either see i know a little about missing persons when kids run they almost always leave a note its guilt they want to say goodbye,3
what,3
ive got what i need for my report there is there is one thing that bothers me though,3
you should be,3
no,3
are you religious,3
were all like that,3
doesnt make much sense does it when everythings happy when lifes fine and you have every reason to believe theres a god you dont bother then something horrible happens thats when you start praying all the time thats when you start going to church,3
okay,3
i i shouldnt take anymore of your time maybe we can finish tomorrow ill call tomorrow,3
of course,3
people remember me from the news can you drive me back now,3
no one knows what its like you cant even imagine how much it hurts,3
i had to ask i apologize,3
you try going through what we did bob couldnt take it thats all christ theres times when it still seems like i cant either,3
i didnt mean to,3
there wasnt anything like that the police and the fbi people asked but there wasnt anything happened like that never my husband his heart broke when mary left,3
you have to forgive me but in these circumstances with your daughter were there any indications of any sort of abuse,3
it got to be too much for him,3
why do you think he did it,3
we were divorced by then things fell apart he was living with a friend,3
september 4th 1993 about a year after mary disappeared,3
yes,3
if theres anything you feel uncomfortable talking about tell me but i have to ask your husband he committed suicide,3
i dont know,3
what was she running from,3
she didnt seem herself for months there never was any way to get her to talk about it one night we went to bed the next morning she was gone she took some clothes,3
she just seemed depressed,3
no,3
so she didnt leave a note she never gave any indication where she might go before she left,3
you probably expect me to be wearing a trench coat and a hat drinking whiskey chasing women and getting beaten up by guys with broken noses want to know what its really like its sitting in a car and staring at a hotel window for three days straight pissing in a plastic bottle pardon me because some guy thinks his wifes cheating on him glamorous huh and the guy who hired you he has a hairlip dandruff and crooked teeth and you could have told him the minute you laid eyes on him his wifes cheating and you dont blame her,3
i didnt think there were private detectives anymore except on tv,3
thats exactly what i am,3
they hired you youre like a private detective,3
its very important you dont let this raise your expectations its not going to effect any ongoing efforts all im saying is please know im not here to create any false hope,3
well im following up on your daughter mary height five four weight hundred ten pounds brown eyes blonde hair born april 24 1976 missing june 11th 1992 a runaway thats how shes listed is this information correct,3
no,3
right agent cole told me hed call and let you know to expect me he didnt call,3
neil neil cole,3
what was the name ive got it here somewhere,3
these volunteer organizations are sort of interconnected functioning hand in hand with law enforcement the rcmp brought me in to review their investigations factcheck their records see if theres anything they missed anything they should be doing different im here for a few days before i head back up to virginia these reports go to the justice department eventually i spoke to your fbi contact a few days ago uh,3
yes but,3
im sorry let me explain the rcmp is a support organization and archive not unlike the center for missing and exploited children in washington im sure youve dealt with them before,3
i dont understand who are,3
ive been hired as an independent contractor by the us resource center for missing persons as part of an internal audit if you have any time over the next few days id like to make an appointment to ask some questions about the disappearance of your daughter,3
hello mrs mathews my names thomas jones im a state licensed investigator,3

try what other kids did keep each other awake well meet at debbies tonight at least if we dont sleep he cant get us,3
then what else can we do,3
yeah right lets trade death by freddy for life in a rubber room adults wont see it they cant,3
why cant we just talk to the authorities,3
you dont really get it hes not a nightstalker itll take more than bench presses to beat him,3
i dont think so i guess this is my own war,3
is there something we can do,3
not really,3
kristen was the last child left of the people who killed freddy maybe freddy cant get to new kids without someone like me someone to bring them to him,3
alright lets assume this whole thing is true why does freddy all of a sudden need you,3
three days,3
how long have you been awake,3
the story is the deaths you cant argue with,3
no offense or anything but its kind of hard to swallow,3
look you know why you just dont believe me,3
extra money huh,3
ive been working double shifts,3
kristens story really got to her,3
no dont i gave sheila to him and now shes dead,3
in her dream,3
i was there in the dream he took her it was awful it was awful,3
it was no suicide it was not an accident it was freddy and hes coming back for seconds thirds and fourths,3
i thought it was an accident smoking in bed,3

rick stayed later after school with kristen she wasnt feeling very well,3

enough of that crap,3
it was freddy,3
asthma attackwhat 17year old has a fatal asthma attack she was gonna be a doctor,3
give her time beauty is skin deep,3
i think sheilas more interested in dissecting bodies than just admiring them,3
alright i think i see salvation,3
rick please,3
what else you ever look over this towns history not a safe place to be a teenager anyway if im next watch your back,3
about freddy,3
shes blaming herself for sheila i know how it feels ive been thinking about kristen maybe i couldve stopped it if id listened,3

why dont i go make some coffee theres a lot to tell,3
tell me some more about this krueger guy,3
it wasnt her mother the only reason were still here is that none of us has slept since the grad party,3
maybe it was her mother who killed her with all that polly perfect shit,3
nobody thinks that,3
do you think im an idiotfor being in love with her,3
mark,3
then get out,3
she mustve fallen asleep at the table,3

im very fucking sorry but greta is dead today could we interest you in someone else,3
i want to talk to both you guys about greta and,3
yeah im just aces,3
mark are you okay,3
thats why its my fault dans dead,3
ive got to write some of this down,3

greta come on one burger with me,3
not to mention the heartbreak of psoriasis,3
i think im starting to wear her down have some anyway,3

i dont believe this all that gore you paint in the comics and youre squeamish,3
oh man i couldve gone all night without looking at that,3
oh he was this ancient guy i read about who like killed his kids cause they didnt want to run the kingdom the way he thought they should,3

next life oh whats that,3
yeah when are you gonna come to your senses,3
all of us right,3
bottom line alice anybody supernatural or not that wants to hurt you hell have to go through us first,3
pushy parents can make you more than a bit crazy,3
look dans parents were pushing him pushing him hard he was bitching about it at the party last night he was under pressure we all are,3
i want to talk about the baby,3
stop saying that its bullshit,3
nah its getting too cold for me and my wonderful mother will kill me if i screw up my hair shes got some model agency guy coming to dinner tomorrow night,3
naah im done got to be on shift in a couple hours arent you going in,3
have another one sounds like you need it,3
that means theyre gonna give me the key to the pool so i can lock up when im done,3
yeah,3
all right kids i tell you what were gonna do ive got swimming practice until sixthirty today,3
makes you look like a nun,3
these things are wild what do you think,3
he invited me to his house last night,3
you too,3
stick around please,3
its okay,3
i cant listen to this,3
im not finished i loved greta a lot and if maybe just maybe someone or some thing killed her id like to hear about it,3
mark,3
why dont you shut up and let her talk two of us died in the last two days does that strike you as particularly normal,3
faint,3
vomit,3
two hours a day six days a week,3
dan and hes taking alice with him pretty good dive yvonne youve been practicing,3
and his egghead son well give em a uroughu ureceptionu wont we,3
i wouldnt worry so long as we have boats like the tiger shark and people like you the skipper dave kent sir ian and my father,3
i dont know,3
but if they udou,3
maybe just maybe when their ship doesnt return theyll decide not to come here after all,3
which is the one we have to worry about,3
yes,3
theyre so remote cold beautiful the stars but now i wonder,3
id sooner swim,3
however our ideas disagree as ive said before im unotu a coward and it happens youve got no choice either uiu take you down there in the lungfish or you dont get there,3
any more than being the son of captain neilsen does,3
thats enough holloway ive told you before wearing boards on your shoulders and parading with a stiff spine doesnt auto matically endow you with back bone,3
thenthis is a flying saucer,3
unidentified flying objects,3
you may not uwinu them but without men like your father to degrade himself by fighting to preserve them or as much as we have of them theyd have disappeared ulongu ago,3
peace the dignity of man the destiny of the human spirit show me a man who says you win uthoseu by fighting wars and uillu show you an idiot,3
you mean unothingu is worth fighting for,3
perhaps but the idea of willingly going to uschoolu to spend my ulifeu at a paleozoic pastime that should have disappeared with the thunderlizards im referring to war uthatu strikes me as the uworstu cowardice of all being spiritually yellow,3
youre really a mixedup oddball arent you,3
that may be but dad stays where uheu is and im staying here,3
were uallu risking our lives,3
wearing a uniform doesnt bestow an automatic monopoly on courage ucommanderu it just so happens im unotu a coward physical or mental and before id risk my fathers life,3
uyouu said it but i wont argue,3
you trade school boys are all alike arent you anybody who doesnt happen to think like a little goldbraided puppet is ipso facto a coward,3
your father can be in nome alaska tomorrow we have two choices ask them to send him out in a copter and take you off or the shark can put back into nome,3
what did you mean im out,3
dead matter of fact hes much better hes left the hospital,3
my father hes not,3
your out this came for you,3
what is it,3
not in two days look do you think i uwantedu to come if it didnt mean so much to dad proving his depthexplorer its the last thing id want,3
you could train someone else,3
and they thought uyouu could re place the skipper,3
it was moderate hell be all right but it was out of the question his coming along,3
how is he,3
it was supposed to be dad had a heart attack two days ago,3
i should have suspectcd when i heard that doctor i thought it was your father,3
whats goin on in here lad what,3
dave,3
oh it does,3
here keep these it wants me to come alone,3
im with uyouu,3
well,3
well have to look for them later,3
wonder where powell and carney are,3
somewhere down there,3
where do you think the voice you heard was coming from,3
the sound again,3
you hear that,3
lets get back to work and maybe we uwillu be soon,3
and if i didnt uknowu better id swear we were moving,3
you know it uisu,3
hey you know somethin its getting lighter in here,3
strange you didnt hear it omit 274f,3
i dont hear anything maybe youve been down here too long why dont you go back up and,3
listen hear that,3
yeah,3
go back and tell dr neilsen have him report to the skipper,3
i think youre right,3
whats more important theres our problem the bow ram the sawteeth are holding the shark in the break if we can cut the ram the shark can pull herself loose,3
how about that the bow drove half through her but she sealed herself right up,3
not ualoneu youre not,3
you all wait here im going inside take a look,3
reef and i can take the explorer down clamp it around the eye and,3
us,3
youve got to let us try skipper,3
skipper look at the depth gauge,3
were stuck tight,3
sounds like it distress call from a small freighter between ellesmere island and greenland one mayday thennothing,3
cyclops,3
his side ive seen it all right a nice bright yellow,3
have you ever talked to carl tried to see his side,3
but utheyreu not skipper neilsens son it broke his heart then when some newspapers called carl the honest sincere son of a warmongering father captain neilsen resigned from the navy oh he still keeps his hand in playing around with projects like the lungfish but it broke him all the same,3
a lot of people think like that,3
so all of a sudden his only son drops out of school be gins making noises like a pacifist a real egghead dogooder and crackpot ban the atom tests junk the nuclear subs spend the mili tary budgetfor peace,3
so,3
one of the finest men and officers alive a real hero in the best sense of the word in world war two he taught us engineering and design fought like a demon to develop atom subs,3
i guess,3
i guess skipper neilsen re tired before you enrolled at the academy didnt he,3
i might have a son like uthatu,3
huh,3
youve asked why i stay a bachelor there goes the best reason i know,3
disappointing a ubigu girl,3
what could be worse than disappoint ing a little girl,3
uthatsu the worst possible moment,3
at the worst possible moment tomorrow is janies birthday poor little kid has looked forward for two months to having her daddy home now,3
so they caught up with you too,3
reef,3
helen i appeal to you,3
but julies a nice girl and ive seen you work she deserves a fighting chance,3
now dave old buddy you know youre exaggerating what do you think of this husband of yours on most boats a certain loyalty exists between the exec and his navigation and firing officer but unfortunately in the case of lieutenant dave milburn of the tiger shark and myself,3
we hope,3
sidearms but the saucers dead,3
with their underwater experience theyll be invaluable take sidearms and flare pistols,3
the frogmen,3
you better take powell and carney with you,3
right at our oneeyed friend,3
what course skipper,3
what,3
a mass of jellylike stuff came out of the thing and caught our torpedo,3
speedabout twentytwo knots coursedue north,3
course and speed,3
idont know,3
what about down,3
seems to be all around,3
is there any way out of it,3
right skipper,3
get ready we shove off as soon as griff reports all the crew aboard,3
what,3
were dead in the water but it indicates were moving,3
why do you say that,3
the inertial navigation system must have been knocked out in the crash,3
something wrong,3
skipper could you take a look here,3
all internal repairs completed and frogmen report exterior damage minor,3
yes griff,3
excuse me skipper,3
what about time,3
its possible i could adapt one of the torpedo guidance systems to the icbm so it would home on the saucer when he rises from the pole,3
anything,3
excuse me captain there may be one last desperate chance a oneinathousand shot,3
radiation levelconstantly rising,3
now they feel itdown below,3
thats wonderful carl reef thinks they can clear the shark bow so we can pull ourself loose,3
wonderful,3
we read you go ahead doctor theyre inside the saucer its filled with breathable air,3
as ready as we ucanu be ill report to the skipper,3
all ready,3
there is i believe our friendcyclops is returning to life,3
theres got to be an explanation,3
as we near the pole,3
what direction does the system indicate,3
the radiation level from the saucer its rising,3
if we were lucky enough to catch him with his power depleted,3
in such a way as to prevent his returning to it and as you put it recharging his batteries,3
the north pole is the positive end of the biggest magnet of all the earth itself,3
uweu harness energy on a small scale by cutting magnetic lines of force maybe cyclops does it on a usuperu scale,3
we took for granted his source of energy was nuclear but suppose it isnt at all what if its umagneticu,3
what if the tiger shark were to anticipate a bit perhaps be lying there waiting,3
suppose our theorizing is correct then this ucouldu be the next danger point,3
above murmansk and finland,3
highintensity arcs will burn submerged and millions of voltsdischarged in random directions,3
under uwateru,3
it doesnt seem possible but could it be an electrical storm center,3
minus three,3
whats the corrected bearing to the magnetic pole,3
nothing we can do now,3
straight to the pole at almost fifty knots,3
if we could get inside the saucer use our torches maybe we could cut the shark loose,3
what,3
suppose theres an atmosphere of some kind inside cyclops,3
and were at safe maximum depth already stop engines,3
its the screws skipper at our declination angle running in reverse theyre pulling the shark uandu cyclops right to the bottom,3
a hundred and eighty fathoms we cant be sinking that fast,3
we can uramu him,3
but what can we accomplish,3
thats what i said,3
right uatu him,3
thirtyfour seconds,3
whats the running time,3
take a look,3
youre sure its cyclops,3
after torpedo room report,3
determine extent of damage immediately,3
i think i should have joined the air force,3
what do you think,3
itll be all right were old friends,3
huh,3
doctor neilsen when did uthatu happen,3
dr neilsen hell be,3
who with,3
im afraid i have some bad news for you reef youll have to share quarters this trip,3
i met dr kent once,3
i did go just back reef these are a couple of our passengers sir ian hunt and dr clifford kent my exec commander richard holloway,3
thought you were going to washington skipper,3
uthatu might be a ulittleu uroughu,3
obviously,3
to navigate wont you have to see your way,3
of course but it is time to be gin the return voyage,3
thats why no water leaked inside when we rammed you,3
it is a living thing when damaged you would say wounded it immediately heals itself,3
i have selected you to return with me along with several other specimens for study we will examine you and the others discover desirable features to incorporate in our earthcolonizers,3
why,3
on the contrary i want you unharmed perfect,3
why not me what am i the closing act,3
i am afraid not therefore,3
he did,3
your friend was to remain where he was,3
swell,3
for horrors like yourself,3
my mission is to study various solar systems and planets select the most suitable for colonization,3
tell me something why can uiu hear you when the others couldnt,3
point of view is everything to us uyouru form of life is ugly as we appear to you,3
thats a ufaceu,3
come where,3
remove your weapons commander and come here alone,3
all right go to it,3
cyclops will have to linger at the pole to recharge his power banks,3
toward the pole,3
due north at five knotsno six,3
but uanswersu are what we need not more questions,3
weve asked ourselves that over and over a thousand times,3
or perhaps until he gets us,3
you plotted the course of cyclops then thats uouru course wherever uheu goes uweu gountil we get him,3
our cyclops throws quite a thunderbolt itself,3
just musing about our oneeyed adversary and the legend of homer cyclopes were the sons of heaven who forged the thunder bolts thrown by zeus,3
ill be another,3
well ill be,3
the pattern each incident occurred almost precisely a thousand statute miles from the pole a line through the points of occurrence makes almost a complete circle,3
see what,3
thank you,3
my yeoman will show you to your quarters,3
all the figures show is that gordon lariviere is going to be a very rich man using his position as selectman in a year or two you wont recognize this town,3

oh,3
hard to say if we go for custody depositions psychiatric evaluations it could drag on ten or twelve thousand dollars she could win on appeal if we just want to get the visitation rights redrawn assuming theyre unduly restrictive it wouldnt be more than twentyfive hundred,3

you know i told you that pavlov and i are going to get married when he comes back from the maneuvers would it be asking too much,3
what is it anna,3
ninotchka i wouldnt bring this up if we werent such good friends,3
you feel it though,3
they must have wonderful materials to make a thing like this so soft something you dont even see,3
well sometimes theyre not completely covered but they dont freeze,3
and there,3
no my dear it is true thats how they live in the other world here we dress to have our bodies covered to keep warm,3
now ninotchka youre exaggerating,3
yes,3
you mean to tell me you wear a different dress for different times of the day,3
when you get up you put on a negligee and then you change to a morning frock,3
what do you wear in the morning,3
a dress you wear in the evening,3
evening gown,3
an evening gown,3
as beautiful as that what else come tell me,3
it was very silly i would be ashamed to wear it here,3
what was it like,3
well a hat,3
tell me what else did you have,3
no i left everything in paris i just happened to be wearing this,3
ninotchka you know i am your friend you can trust me did you bring back anything else,3
thank you anna ill dry it up here when i wash it next i should hate to see our country endangered by my underwear,3
you know how it is today all you have to do is wear a pair of silk stockings and they suspect you of counterrevolution,3
i see,3
when i passed through the laundry yard today i saw all the women huddled around this so i brought it up here things like this create a bad feeling first they didnt know whose it was then they saw the paris label and did it start a commotion some said its what we all ought to wear and others said its like hanging foreign ideas on our clothesline it undermines our whole cause,3
you should ill show you,3
i have nothing to hide,3
thats just it it makes people feel queer i dont want you to get in any trouble,3
i havent talked to anyone about paris i havent said a word,3
ever since you have been back from paris,3
about what,3
and you too ninotchka,3
you should be more careful anna,3
ill tell you later that gurganov you never know whether hes on his way to the washroom or the secret police,3
it just goes to prove the theory of our state if you stand alone it means a boiled egg but if youre true to the collective spirit and stick together youve got an omelet that reminds me have you heard the latest theyre telling about the kremlin,3
well ive saved up two eggs and each of my friends is bringing his own so well manage,3
an omelet arent you living a little above your ration,3
an omelet,3
what are you serving,3
a few friends just a little dinner party,3
i know my heart is sad but my feet are happy when all the tanks and guns were roaring over the red square i sat here all by myself and played a beethoven sonata not bad at all are you expecting someone,3
too bad you missed an inspiring day anna,3
they didnt let me i am in disgrace last week at the performance of carmen i played a sour note the conductor got so excited he yelled theres sabotage in the string section,3
no the opera starts an hour later tonight on account of the parade,3
arent you late,3
good evening ninotchka,3
good evening anna,3
right now its on the balcony,3
it may step out of a bazaar it may wait for you in a corridor it may hide in the shadow of a minaret,3
imagine we dont have to whisper any longer,3
we are not comrades any more we are friends ninotchka,3
i know but if we cant put in all these wonderful things at least lets put in some imagination in that one omelet well taste the whole of paris,3
and the surprise is theres nothing in it,3
des raisins de mad???re des framboises,3
lets fill it with confitures des prunes,3
i should be a swallow right now i would be sitting in front of the caf??? de paris picking up flakes of french pastry that would melt in my bill,3
if you asked him why he left france i bet he couldnt name one good reason,3
it is ninotchka it is he must have been in paris you can see it in his whole attitude he just picked up a crumb of our black bread shook his head and dropped it,3
thats another thing its spring,3
can you blame them at least the may day parade is over,3
how nicely youve fixed the table ninotchka,3
a little more tact look how nicely shes fixed the table all for us,3
i can tell you exactly,3
if you hadnt given commissar razinin such a wonderful report about us who knows what would have happened,3
thats right,3
imagine for once in our lives we were in paris and we never went to the eiffel tower,3
or we cant go back to russia,3
or it might be the firing squad,3
you must help us leon if you dont win her over were on our way to siberia,3
once in petersburg i was driving down the nevsky prospect in my cart and her highness in her troika swept down from the opposite direction and when i couldnt make way quick enough she spat in my face,3
imagine the niece of the czar opening the door for us,3
thats her,3
positively not,3
no thats not him,3
possibly,3
are we free buljanoff,3
and little lady beatrice,3
and how is lord lavenham,3
hes a bad man sends people to siberia,3
you wouldnt like razinin,3
all right lets uphold it for another ten minutes,3
comrades comrades dont lets give in so quickly after all we have to uphold the prestige of russia,3
i dont want to go to siberia,3
are you the buljanoff who fought on the barricades and now you are afraid to take a room with a bath,3
no thats bad management,3
we can say whatever we want we can shout we can complain look the service in this hotel is terrible see nobody comes nobody pays any attention thats freedom,3
lets forget the future lets stop being sentimental lets start that omelet,3
and if it is too late for you your children will eat it,3
just see how happy the people look from here,3
shes right anyhow lets talk ourselves into it,3
how many families live here with you,3
what a lovely room you have here,3
and thats something we owe to ninotchka,3
lets be happy that were all alive,3
thats right and we might as well face it,3
you know what they say theres nothing like home,3
leon how would you like to have three lifelong friends,3
yes we could stay with leon,3
what do you mean they might they will,3
and they might believe her in moscow,3

ali baba and the forty thieves into one single hour you can crowd a thousand and one nights,3
ninotchka we are in the magic east the country of aladdin and his lamp,3

thank you for a wonderful dinner,3
well i think its getting late good night ninotchka,3
so it blows up that big what they call an omelette surprise,3
des petites fraises des bois de la cr???me de bretagne,3

while you eat you look at the view,3
they tell me it has a wonderful restaurant on the second floor,3
we avoided luxury and extravagance and today well if you were to offer us a glass of champagne we wouldnt say no,3
we dont blame you leon but when we came from russia we believed in simplicity,3
how can you find somebody without knowing what he looks like,3

that wont help you you cant intimidate us,3
i give you my word they were confiscated legally,3
we can call our ambassador,3
these may have been the jewels of the duchess swana but like all private property they were confiscated by the state,3
you know monsieur mercier this is all nonsense,3
do we give the impression of people who are pressed for money,3
we can wait,3
he wouldnt say that what he would say is buljanoff you cant afford to live in a cheap hotel doesnt the prestige of the bolsheviks mean anything to you do you want to live in a hotel where you press for the hot water and cold water comes and when you press for the cold water nothing comes out at all phooey buljanoff,3
if lenin were alive he would say buljanoff comrade for once in your life youre in paris dont be a fool go in there and ring three times,3
i dont want to go to the hotel terminus,3
comrades if we ring nine times lets go in,3
they tell me when you ring once the valet comes in when you ring twice you get the waiter and do you know what happens when you ring three times a maid comes in a french maid,3
lets be honest have we anything like it in russia,3
comrades why should we lie to each other its wonderful,3
no no,3
you found your way to us and we werent easy to reach were we,3
i think she covered you with the parasites,3

yes monsieur,3
a special envoy is coming from moscow hell occupy the royal suite move our things to the smallest room youve got,3
but gentlemen i am afraid,3

im afraid we have no boxes of that size in our vault but there is one suite with a private safe,3
oh yes but have you a safe here big enough to hold this,3
i might be able to accommodate you is there some more luggage,3
monsieur,3
this is comrade kopalski,3
just looking around,3
yes monsieur,3
we cant but you are so ingenious leon,3

she doesnt leave her room she has been locked in for the last two days with lawyers and law books,3
well boys id like to help you but what can i do yesterday i waited six hours in the lobby,3

if we say that leon well be sent to siberia,3
how does this strike you commissar razinin board of trade moscow unexpected situation here duchess swana in paris claims jewels and has already brought injunction against sale or removal after long and careful study we suggest in the interest of our beloved country a fiftyfifty settlement as best solution iranoff buljanoff and kopalski,3
all right go ahead you talk to the lawyer and ill talk to the judge,3
we havent anything to discuss with you well talk to a lawyer,3
yes a very slim one i want to be fair i dont deny that you might make out some kind of a case,3
we may have a chance,3
just a moment i hope you havent closed this deal monsieur mercier it might bring you into serious difficulties,3
now monsieur you have no right,3
dont make it difficult for me this is no more a pleasure trip for me than it is for you,3
and kopalski,3
we will get that well get everything maybe a little bit later but well get it we must be patient finally we got the spring didnt we we got the swallows and you will get your apfel strudel too,3
yes a good piece of apfel strudel,3
now comrades there is something better in life than crumbs of french pastry,3
even the swallows are back,3
the same spring we had in paris just as good,3
and its great think what it was a few years ago and what it is now,3
yes theres no doubt of that just look out of the window and there it is,3
sssh once and for all were in moscow,3
and your own gas cooker thats marvelous naturally its not the royal suite,3
well were back home,3
how are you you three scoundrels,3
no not a thing would you like to go out,3
if there is anything we can do for you,3
oh yes power and light thank you,3
i acted on your suggestion and got in touch with the power and light authorities whenever you want to visit their plants they are open to you,3
you comrade iranoff go to the public library and get me the section of the civil code on property,3
yes comrade,3
we cannot feed the russian people on your intentions fifty per cent to a socalled duchess half of every loaf of bread to our enemy comrade kopalski go at once to our embassy and get the address of the best lawyer in paris,3
we did it with the best intentions,3
will you send me some cigarettes please comrades i am not in a position to pass final judgment but at best you have been careless in your duty to the state you were entrusted with more than a mere sale of jewelry why are we peddling our precious possessions to the world at this time our next years crop is in danger and you know it unless we can get foreign currency to buy tractors there will not be enough bread for our people and you three comrades,3
i will not repeat your mistake i will have no dealings with the grand duchess nor her representative,3
we dealt directly with the representative of the grand duchess i am sure if we call him he will give you a very clear picture,3
i hope so for your sake let us examine the case what does the lawyer say,3
we did our best comrade,3
i am ashamed to put the picture of lenin in a room like this comrades your telegram was received with great disfavor in moscow,3
its a hat comrade a womans hat,3
whats that,3
no thank you,3
allow me comrade,3
why why should you carry other peoples bags,3
he is a porter he wants to carry them,3
dont make an issue of my womanhood we are here for work all of us lets not waste time shall we go,3
if we had known we would have greeted you with flowers,3
au revoir,3
well leave these papers here for your further consideration au revoir madame,3
well theres nothing we can do about it why get excited,3
yes it is unfortunate,3

im sorry gentlemen the other day i heard such a funny story it still makes me laugh it is very funny i am sorry oh yes about this injunction,3
im sorry sir but i must insist,3
you want me to go in there,3
she has been asked to leave the powder room but without success we would appreciate if you would see to it yourself,3
what can i do about it,3
that kind of propaganda is bad anywhere but inciting the attendants of a powder room to go on strike well if she succeeds the consequences will be disastrous,3
give me another double brandy,3
suspicions nothing but suspicions thats the trouble with you if you dont let me in ill stand in front of this office of yours and warn people to keep away from russia ill picket your whole country,3
or a tunnel or a bridge,3
what for why,3
how do i know you dont want to blow up a factory,3
on what,3
why should i take a chance,3
now look here you advertise all over the world that you want people to go into your country and when someone tries to get in you keep him out,3
youre going to force us huh,3
thats impossible nobody has the right you cant do that if you dont give me that visa,3

a funny story,3
quickly please tell me one of your funny stories,3
and general savitzky,3
how do you do,3
there have been cases but the headache the next morning is worth while if you drink it with the right toast to us ninotchka,3
from what i read i thought champagne was a strong drink its very delicate do people ever get drunk on this,3
from goats to grapes thats drinking in the right direction,3
its funny to look back i was brought up on goats milk i had a ration of vodka in the army and now champagne,3
its always good luck to launch something with champagne a battleship or an evening,3
i wouldnt know the closest i ever came to champagne was in a newsreel the wife of some president was throwing it at a battleship,3
my darling,3
leon dont ever ask me for a picture of myself i couldnt bear the thought of being shut up in a drawer i couldnt breathe i couldnt stand it,3
ninotchka youre jealous,3
i suppose she is very entertaining it must be lots of fun to be with her so witty so glamorous,3
ninotchka i love you,3
she is very attractive she has great elegance shes what you call a woman of the world isnt she,3
when i was here before i noticed a photograph of a woman on the desk in a wide silver frame i thought what a waste of silver thats all that interested me then now i would like to know what happened to the woman,3
i dont think so,3
did you make any change in this room,3
i promise i swear,3
if you dont want to answer you neednt but if you do you must tell me the truth,3
anything ninotchka,3
leon i would like to ask you something,3
leon i want to tell you something which i thought i never would say which i thought nobody ever should say because i thought it didnt exist and leon i cant say it,3
no go on,3
leon you know the jokes you told me a few days ago i wake up in the middle of the night and laugh at them now leon thats wrong i know theyre not funny theyre silly theyre stupid and still i laugh and when i look at buljanoff and iranoff and kopalski i know they are scoundrels and i should hate them then i realize who made them like that and instead of sending my report to moscow i tear it up and go down and buy a ridiculous hat and if this keeps on am i too talkative,3
you see i couldnt shout that,3
not radio lets have music thats just for ourselves,3
a wonderful idea radio or records,3
well first i should like to take off my hat and jacket then could we have some music,3
thats when one half of paris says to the other half what are your plans for this evening madame,3
its nine oclock,3
twelve seventyfive from the clarence the sonofagun made a detour but he got you here,3
for twelve francs seventyfive,3
you see life can be so simple,3
ive never been here before i wonder whom youre thinking of oh i know a girl with a map figuring out each step worrying about north and south today now this might shock you i went up to a taxi and said eight rue du bois and here i am,3
you remember this room,3
foolish if this dress were to walk down the boulevard all by itself i would follow it from one end of paris to the other and when i caught up with it i would say just a moment you charming little dress i want you to meet ninotchka you two were meant for each other ninotchka feels more comfortable,3

it seemed funny to me when i first heard it maybe the trouble isnt with the joke maybe its with you,3
no,3
i suppose you dont think thats funny,3
so do i now heres a great one ha ha ha well maybe its not so good lets forget it hows this two men are looking at the moon one says to the other is it true that a lot of people live on the moon yes it is says the other five hundred million whew replies the first they must get pretty crowded when its half moon ha ha ha,3
i wish they had never met,3
two scotchmen met on the street and i dont know the name of the street and it really doesnt matter well anyway ones name was mcintosh and the others was mcgillicuddy mcintosh says to mcgillicuddy hello mr mcgillicuddy and mcgillicuddy says to mcintosh hello mr mcintosh and then mcintosh says to mcgillicuddy how is mrs mcgillicuddy and then mcgillicuddy says to mcintosh how is mrs mcintosh,3
i have never heard one,3
do you like scotch stories,3
probably not,3
well er lets drop it i dont think you would care for that one,3
on which boat,3
thats not a laugh i mean a laugh from the heart now lets see im going to tell you a funny story just a moment ive got it well it seems there were a couple of frenchmen who went to america,3
ha ha now go back,3
no i cant leave you i wont not yet not until ive made you laugh at least once,3
then you should go back to your table,3
because we are an odd couple,3
why,3
at anything at the whole ludicrous spectacle of life at people being pompous and taking themselves seriously and exaggerating their own importance if you cant find anything else to laugh at you can laugh at you and me,3
at what,3
just smile,3
why,3
will you smile,3
what,3
death death always so glum what about life ninotchka do russians never think of life of the moment in which we are living the only moment we really have dont take it all so seriously ninotchka nothing is worth it please relax i beg you sergeant smile,3
but you have now and i know now that you are a man who employs business methods which in russia would be punished by death,3
oh ninotchka who wants to talk business if you win the suit fine if we win the suit better you do me an injustice when we went to my apartment did i have the slightest idea that you had any connection with this deal,3
your tactics are useless my name is neither buljanoff iranoff nor kopalski,3
must one always be after something,3
what are you after,3
just an old man his memory is getting weak,3
but my dear child i am most at home among working men i hate the places where you circulate the hotel clarence this is my natural element after all what are any of us workingmen at least those of us who are worth our salt hyah,3
this is a place for workmen,3
i always eat here,3
then how did you get here,3
i didnt follow you,3
i dont like your following me,3
pardon me for addressing you but you insulted him you know that you hurt his feelings it was just like telling a musician you dont like music that good old man believes in food as you believe in karl marx you cant go around hurting people comrade yakushova but maybe you can make it up to him do you know how by eating everything with relish by drinking everything with gusto by having a good time for the first time in your natural life,3
so you want to make a strike breaker out of me i am surprised at you comrade is it too much for the workers of the world to ask you to walk around the corner for lunch all i can say to you is take your hammer and sickle and get out of that royal suite,3
send me a plate of raw carrots and beets beets predominating on a ratio of sixtyforty what there is a strike in the kitchen good will you assure the strikers of my hearty sympathy in their cause i hope they will not weaken in their demands and tell them to put no dressing whatsoever on my vegetables what you wont serve me either now look here comrade i think it is a fine idea to let the capitalists go without luncheon but when you keep food away from me youre weakening the people,3
room service speaking,3
i kissed the polish lancer too before he died,3
but ninotchka i held you in my arms you kissed me,3
ninotchka you cant walk out like this im crazy about you and i thought id made an impression on you you liked the white of my eye,3
then do it through my lawyer,3
you know i want to,3
it is out of the question if you wish to approach me,3
tonight lets not represent anybody but ourselves,3
as a representative of moscow,3
all right fight me fight me as much as you want but fight me tomorrow morning theres nothing sweeter than sharing a secret with a bitter enemy,3
i was sent here by my country to fight you,3
i have a better suggestion lets forget that the telephone ever rang i never heard that you are yakushova you are ninotchka my ninotchka,3
lets forget that we ever met,3
ninotchka or shall i say special envoy yakushova,3
i must go,3
but one of your friends may be in need of you you must answer,3
oh let it ring,3
the telephone is ringing,3
glorious analytical,3
oh my barbaric ninotchka my impossible unromantic statistical,3
thank you,3
no that was restful again,3
was that talkative,3
you analyze everything out of existence you analyze me out of existence i wont let you love is not so simple ninotchka ninotchka why do doves bill and coo why do snails coldest of all creatures circle interminably around each other why do moths fly hundreds of miles to find their mates why do flowers open their petals oh ninotchka ninotchka surely you feel some slight symptom of the divine passion a general warmth in the palms of your hands a strange heaviness in your limbs a burning of the lips that is not thirst but a thousand times more tantalizing more exalting than thirst,3
its false sentimentality,3
i cant possibly think of a better reason,3
thats the way a clock works theres nothing wonderful about it you merely feel you must put yourself in a romantic mood to add to your exhilaration,3
its midnight one half of paris is making love to the other half look at the clock one hand has met the other hand they kiss isnt that wonderful,3
its twelve oclock,3
do you hear that,3
youre the most adorable cog i ever saw in my life ninotchka cogitska let me confess something never did i dream i could feel like this toward a sergeant,3
just what you see a tiny cog in the great wheel of evolution,3
what kind of a girl are you anyway,3
dont pity me pity the polish lancer after all im alive,3
poor ninotchka poor poor ninotchka,3
a polish lancer i was sixteen,3
id love to tsk tsk tsk,3
i was a sergeant in the third cavalry brigade would you like to see my wound,3
wounded how,3
i was wounded before warsaw,3
the bayonet did you really,3
its never too late to change i used to belong to the petty bourgeoisie myself my father and mother wanted me to stay and work on the farm but i preferred the bayonet,3
im at a loss ninotchka you must forgive me if i appear a little old fashioned after all im just a poor bourgeois,3
dont do it please,3
id like to say it a thousand times,3
you repeat yourself,3
youre the most improbable creature ive ever met in my life ninotchka ninotchka,3
you dont have to do a thing chemically we are already quite sympathetic,3
what can i possibly do to encourage such an impulse in you,3
i acknowledge the existence of a natural impulse common to all,3
oh i see what do you use instead,3
you are bringing in wrong values love is a romantic designation for a most ordinary biological or shall we say chemical process a lot of nonsense is talked and written about it,3
your cornea is terrific tell me youre so expert on things can it be that im falling in love with you,3
look at me the whites of your eyes are clear your cornea is excellent,3
thank you,3
your general appearance is not distasteful,3
ninotchka do you like me just a little bit,3
that is correct,3
ninotchka,3
you pronounce it incorrectly ni notchka,3
i begin to believe in it myself since ive met you i still dont know what to make of it it confuses me it frightens me a little but it fascinates me ninotchka,3
that is why i believe in the future of my country,3
thank you thank you,3
you are something we do not have in russia,3
for mankind not a thing for womankind the record is not quite so bleak,3
and what do you do for mankind,3
keeping my body fit keeping my mind alert keeping my landlord appeased thats a fulltime job,3
and what is your profession,3
thats great im thirtyfive years old just over six feet tall i weigh a hundred and eightytwo pounds stripped,3
i will start with you,3
not too big and not too small what id call the typical room of an average man or shall we say a little above average now if there are any special aspects you wish to study i have nothing to conceal just look around thats my desk those are my books and here am i where shall we begin,3
i should say this room is eighteen by twentyfive,3
it helps it has ever since king david wooed bathsheba with the harp as i am not so fortunate as to have my harp at hand i shall turn on the radio,3
is that customary,3
we take off our hat and coat we sit down we make ourselves comfortable we adjust ourselves to the prospect of a most enjoyable evening we look at each other we smile well we dont smile how about some music,3
what do we do now,3
thank you ive had all the calories necessary for today,3
well may i offer you a drink or how about something to eat,3
the day will come when you will be free go to bed little father we want to be alone,3
no though the mere thought makes my mouth water,3
he looks sad do you whip him,3
he takes good care of that,3
good evening comrade this man is horribly old you should not make him work,3
yes,3
is this what you call the butler,3
i will do my best,3
then why dont we go you might be an interesting subject of study,3
now i didnt say that either naturally nothing would please me more,3
then you dont want me to go there,3
please dont misunderstand me,3
does that mean that you want me to go there,3
well lets say i live in it such a pleasant place all kinds of comfort easy to reach close to street car bus and subway,3
so that is your house,3
its not the structure but the spirit which dwells within there are three rooms and a kitchenette dedicated to hospitality,3
i see a house that looks like any other house whats remarkable about it,3
what a city there are the grands boulevards blasted out of the heart of the old streets the arc de triomphe made to greet napoleons army the opera and montmartre montparnasse la boh???me and now ill show you the greatest attraction it will cost me a franc but it is worth it the most wonderful spot in all paris unique here look what do you see,3
i do not deny its beauty but it is a waste of electricity,3
you must admit that this doomed old civilization sparkles it glitters,3
do not misunderstand me i do not hold your frivolity against you as basic material you might not be bad but you are the unfortunate product of a doomed culture i feel sorry for you,3
im glad i saw it before becoming extinct,3
yes it is,3
and thank you for getting me up here ive never seen this before beautiful isnt it,3
you gave me some very valuable information thank you,3
yes very strange,3
thats a strange angle,3
four massive piers of masonry are sunk to a depth of fortysix feet on the side of the seine and twenty nine and onehalf feet on the other side the girders of interlaced iron work which stay the structure have an inclination of fiftyfour degrees,3
go ahead,3
the foundation is one hundred and fortyone yards square i hope youll forgive me but i thought youd,3
your type will soon be extinct,3
a russian i love russians comrade i have been fascinated by your five year plan for the past fifteen years,3
i have heard of the arrogant male in capitalistic society it is having a superior earning power that makes you like that,3
nothing has occurred recently to shake my confidence,3
you are very sure of yourself arent you,3
madame it is that kind of approach which has made paris what it is,3
for my own information would you call your approach toward me typical of the local morale,3
ill try,3
suppress it,3
i dont have to but i find it natural,3
i am interested only in the shortest distance between these two points must you flirt,3
here here we are here you are and here i am feel it,3
and where are we,3
bad manners to point with your own here the eiffel tower,3
why do you need my finger,3
now isnt that too bad the last time i jumped i forgot to clock it let me see eiffel tower your finger please,3
how long does it take a man to land,3
technical i couldnt help you from that angle you see a real parisian only goes to the top of the tower in moments of despair to jump off,3
i am interested in the eiffel tower from a technical standpoint,3
is that thing lost again listen if you are interested in a view,3
no i am looking for the eiffel tower,3
facing north id hate to commit myself without my compass pardon me are you an explorer,3
correct me if i am wrong we are facing north arent we,3
love to,3
you might hold this for me,3
can i help you,3
youre welcome,3
thank you,3
no,3
in other words you dont know,3
have i do you know when i come to think about it its staggering if i add it all up i must have spent years waiting for signals imagine an important part of my life wasted between whistles,3
have you never been caught in a similar situation,3
thats funny its interesting i never gave it a thought before,3
how many minutes between the first and second whistle,3
what,3
at what intervals does he whistle,3
well until the policeman whistles again,3
how long do we have to wait here,3
gladly,3
yes could you give me some information,3
me,3
you please,3
thank you swana you are very gracious,3
just in case they dont give you your visa to russia i want you to know that i have signed a contract for my memoirs and rented a lovely little ch???teau in the touraine and if you feel the need of a change,3
that does it swana now you mustnt miss your appointment with your hairdresser,3
count dalgout was for several years my personal representative and if it is necessary to sign any affidavit for him ill be delighted,3
now please swana,3
after our talk last night i took it for granted that you would drop in here this morning knowing how difficult it is to get into soviet russia i thought i might be of some assistance to you may i introduce myself i am the duchess swana of russia another russia,3
hello,3
hello leon darling,3
do you expect me to believe that,3
shes gone leon,3
has done what,3
knowing the efficiency of the french air service i think i can guarantee that madame yakushova has already taken off for moscow,3
what is this swana,3
the same old trouble leon youre always late whether youre taking me to the opera or calling for me at a beauty shop youre never on time and now when its a question of your reform late again by about five minutes,3
im afraid thats what it is,3
leon this has the ugly sound of regeneration,3
i have to be simple again swana and you may find it shockingly banal ive thought it over and im willing to take all the consequences even if it means a complete readjustment of my way of living,3
say it over and over again leon words are a wonderful safety valve and thats what you need because you know its impossible dont you,3
it must be serious swana not long ago id have considered such a statement rather juvenile and rather middle class now i can say it without stammering without a blush im in love swana,3
and i thought it was something serious how could you frighten me so,3
there are a hundred ways to approach it but i feel it can best be said in one simple phrase im in love swana,3
brutal frankness if you insist,3
i know you hate the obvious but do you mind if at this moment im not in the least subtle,3
all right ill listen,3
this time swana just this once i must ask you to listen,3
oh no my little volga boatman have you forgotten our first commandment never complain never explain it has worked so often and so perfectly dont lets break the rule and please dont look so guilty otherwise ill,3
yes,3
is this by any chance going to be a confession,3
im the one who should apologize i should have talked to you before,3
did i act stupidly last night should i apologize,3
no thanks swana,3
leon darling how nice have you ordered tea or a cocktail,3
a very wise suggestion leon im afraid madame and i will never agree the only thing we have in common is our lawsuit and that will be decided next week i understand everything will be over by thursday am i right,3
will you do me a favor stop talking about the good old days,3
im going leon but before i leave i must compliment you on your gown madame yakushova is that what theyre wearing in moscow this year,3
theres a charming crowd here tonight isnt there,3
poor madame yakushova here we are talking in mysteries im sure you wonder what its all about,3
months swana,3
he won another blue ribbon and bit the judge ha ha ha i bought him the cutest sweater as a reward you should see him strut down the street in it he looks like a little boulevardier you see count dalgout gave me punchy for my birthday you must have searched weeks before you found anything as divine as punchy didnt you leon,3
no please,3
ive some wonderful news for you leon its about punchy do you mind if i sit down,3
how do you do,3
not at all your highness may i present madame yakushova,3

yes swana,3
its a dream of beauty he never takes my word for anything but i was right wasnt i,3
yes swana you did,3
didnt i tell you benson and benson were the tailors for you,3
yes swana,3
is this your new dress suit,3
thank you,3
now darling soak in your beautiful pine bath and let gaston shave you,3
darling if were going to get anywhere someone has to keep his eyes open,3
you saw all that in one glimpse,3
timeless when she comes into a room youd think that the bolsheviks had taken over paris she wears her cheap miserable blouse as though it were the latest model by schiaparelli what a woman what a woman there is a russian snowstorm in each of her eyes,3
that bad old or young,3
you cant imagine,3
imagine the carpets of a self respecting parisian hotel dirtied by the boots of a muzhik what does she look like,3
well er i caught a glimpse of her when she walked through the lobby,3
you just told me you hadnt seen her,3
that wouldnt have done any good not with her shes the most incredible creature ive ever seen,3
that proletarian in the old days wed have had her flogged,3
no and believe me ive tried everything i must have telephoned her a hundred times ive sent her telegrams ive sent her flowers i asked her to dinner i offered her seats for the opera,3
you havent seen her yet,3
oh please swana i dont know whether im standing on my head or my heels here you are blaming me for neglecting you when im trying to concentrate on another woman and cant get near her,3
now here we have two very handsome softboiled eggs do you suppose hens mind what happens to their eggs probably not they have such unfeeling eyes well put in a great nugget of butter plenty of pepper and salt darling i havent seen you for three livelong days seventytwo hours,3
not in your condition make it tepid gaston tepid and tender and lay out his gray suit afterwards ill drive you through the bois slowly in waltz time,3
make it ice cold,3
darling youre taking my business affairs far too seriously much as id love to rob the bolsheviks of their filthy money i wont do it at the expense of your health particularly as we know we wont get much you look so pale pale but interesting,3
i just couldnt sleep i got up and went back and then got up again these last few days whew,3
dont tell me the bed has lost its best friend,3
no,3
is anything wrong are you ill,3
huh,3
leon what in heavens name,3
darling calm down why do you need a lawyer havent you your little volga boatman,3
it looks pretty hopeless there may be a chance thats all the french government has recognized soviet russia and he doubts that they will risk a war for my poor sake he might be able to make up some kind of a case but it would cost money money money thats all they are interested in those lawyers,3
what did he say,3
shhh but how can there be a question are you my lawyer or theirs all right ill let you know,3
what does he say,3
this is the duchess swana i want to speak to monsieur cornillon its very important please get him right away hello monsieur cornillon the most incredible thing has happened my jewels are here in paris three bolshevik swine are trying to sell them yes yes we must act immediately call the police have them arrested well then get an injunction but do something monsieur cornillon but they are my jewels there must be some way of getting them back,3
rakonin bless him has given me the most amazing news,3
did i hear something about jewels,3
tell him i wont be able to see him for a half an hour,3
oh yes,3
hes a waiter at the clarence poor devil you know him,3
too bad brings our price down ten thousand francs,3
was i no not by a bolshevik,3
darling this would be wonderful just once werent you attacked by a bolshevik,3
a couple of bloodhounds and we have uncle toms cabin,3
ive got one chapter guizot thinks is terrific caviar and blood swana escapes over the ice,3
well two million readers i know exactly what they want chapter one a childhood behind golden bars lovely little princess plays with rasputins beard,3
yes im your little volga boatman,3
first tell me are you my little volga boatman,3
now swana,3
my little volga boatman stop threatening i dont deserve this are you my little volga boatman,3
imagine two million clerks and shop girls peeking into my life for a sou think of my lovely life being wrapped around cheese and blood sausages i can see a big grease spot in the midst of my most intimate moments,3
i understand how you feel but there is a limit to everything particularly pride and dignity they are willing to pay any price they have a circulation of two million,3
was it for this that i refused to endorse dr bertrands mouthwash i could have made a little fortune by saying that the vincent vacuum cleaner was the only vacuum cleaner ever used by the romanoffs and now you want them to smear my lifes secrets over the front page of a tabloid,3
sweetheart we wont have to bother about our future if you are willing to raffle off your past,3
oh leon,3
now listen swana i sold monsieur guizot the idea of publishing your memoirs in the gazette parisienne the life and loves of the grand duchess swana of russia,3
what a gruesome proof of the power of the press,3
youd be surprised how many nice people dine with the guizots,3
those newspaper people,3
we can be rich if you say the word i had dinner with the guizots last night,3
oh leon you are so good to me,3
we can forget horse racing roulette the stock market our worries are over you remember that platinum watch with the diamond numbers you will be in a position to give it to me,3
did you win,3
darling i was busy looking out for your interests,3
dont you find that restful why didnt you come last night,3
your conversation has one marvelous advantage swana however many questions you ask you never expect an answer,3
its really a wretched morning wretched i cant get myself right i wanted to look mellow and i look brittle my face doesnt compose well all highlights how can i dim myself down leon suggest something i am so bored with this face i wish i had someone elses face whose face would you have if you had your choice oh well i guess one gets the face one deserves,3
good morning swana,3
hello leon,3
i think i know leon quite as well as you possibly a little better leave that worry to me fiveforty leaves you time enough to close the deal with monsieur mercier but naturally youll be too busy for any farewells ill see to it that everything is done in the most expeditious manner and i will also see you to the airport thats my proposition comrade yakushova,3
thats not the way to win him back not leon,3
i am willing to hand over the jewels and sign the necessary papers if you take that fiveforty plane to moscow,3
go on,3
no i just wanted to be absolutely impartial both of us are faced with two rather uncomfortable years we can condense these two years to two minutes if you want to accept my proposition ninotchka now realizes what she is after,3
i see you have calculated in terms of hunger,3
i may run out of money but you have already run out of bread two years is a long time for your comrades to wait,3
wont those two years in court be expensive for you i know that money was no object as long as you could squeeze it from the pockets of the people but now,3
my lawyer agrees with you he says france will uphold it in every court but i will drag you through every court dont forget that and when i say it will take two years i am as always conservative,3
under soviet law the jewels belong to the state france is going to uphold that ownership,3
unfortunately,3
in other words moral ideas have no weight with you all right then lets deal with legal facts you know that france has recognized the soviet,3
now lets free ourselves from emotionalism and try to solve the problem in a practical way our situation has changed considerably before i had only a claim to the jewels now i have the jewels,3
i told you we had plenty to talk about shall we sit down,3
they always belonged to the russian people they were paid for with their sweat their blood their lives and you will give them back,3
thats very simple to answer they were given to me by my mother they were given to her by her mother in fact theyre mine you cannot steal what belongs to you,3
i will have to face the consequences but so will you dont forget they will ask how you got them,3
wont it be rather embarrassing for a soviet envoy to disclose the circumstances under which she lost them,3
you leave me no choice,3
dont worry fortunately last night a very trustworthy friend kept his eyes open perhaps he overstepped his function as a waiter but he fulfilled his duty as a russian i just put this on for sentiment the rest are absolutely safe i assure you but if you feel like notifying the police,3
where are they,3
you were very careless with our precious jewels my dear theyre too expensive a toy for two children to play with,3
where are they,3
believe me leon cant help you he doesnt know anything about the jewels i give you my word i swear it,3
i told you to go madame,3
i wouldnt waken leon after last night i would say not before three oclock at the earliest,3
in that case i can only say goodby,3
not before you agree to use those reservations to moscow,3
i must insist that you leave,3
you cant deny we gave the people their moneys worth almost eight tumbling romanoffs eight,3
my dear you dont know how impressive i could be did you ever see me in my regalia with my diadem and all my jewels,3
it is not enough to be witty madame people grow tired of being entertained you made that mistake before problems were never solved by bowing from a balcony,3
very interesting my dear but couldnt you write all that from moscow a dissertation on love on soviet stationery would be an amusing paradox,3
people cannot be taken away madame neither a hundred and sixty million nor one not if you have their love you hadnt thats why youre not in russia any longer and thats why you came here this morning,3
my palace in petrograd yes you took that away from me you took away my czar my country my people everything i had but nothing more i warn you,3
if this is meant to be a joke it is not funny or do you still think youre issuing orders from your palace in petrograd,3
dont worry i have already made reservations its perfect flying weather they assure me theres a fine tail wind which will sweep you back to moscow in no time,3
madame if you,3
leave thats exactly what i came here to ask you to do leave i dont mean this hotel and i dont mean paris i mean france theres a plane for moscow at fiveforty,3
i must ask you to leave,3
thats all right i grow on people,3
madame what is it you people always say regardless of what you mean i am delighted to have you here i have not reached that stage of civilization,3
now there you are completely wrong if we sit down for a little chat im sure we wont run out of conversation and whats more it wont be dull,3
we have nothing to discuss,3
i just dropped in to have a little hearttoheart talk with you,3
please come to the point what is it you want,3
dont worry you were quite rude enough do you mind if i let in a little fresh air and sunshine im sure it will make you feel better and i want you to be at your very best in full possession of your faculties at least,3
if you were encouraged to come here by our meeting last night i am afraid you misunderstood my attitude,3
how stale last nights gaiety looks it has the taste of a dead cigarette,3
of course not my dear i didnt come here with any such suspicion how ridiculous nor did i come here to pick up his hat,3
i think we can cut your visit short leon is not here,3
it is tomorrow morning tomorrow noon to be exact i hope you will forgive me i know its extremely cruel to waken anyone at such an hour dont you recognize me i am the duchess swana,3
what,3
good morning,3
it is unfortunate that you have so few more days in paris be sure and redouble your efforts so that madame can take some pleasant memories when she returns to moscow good night good night leon,3
youre right madame it will all be over by thursday,3
youre absolutely right about the cossacks we made an unpardonable mistake when we let them use their knouts they had such reliable guns,3
exactly you see it would have been embarrassing for people of my sort to wear lowcut gowns in the old russia the lashes of the cossacks across our backs were not very becoming and you know how vain women are,3
isnt it amazing one gets a wrong impression of the new russia it must be charming im glad conditions are so improved i assume this is what the factory workers wear at their dances,3
dear me i must be losing my finesse if im not careful ill be understood by everybody,3
not at all i understand perfectly count dalgout gave you a dog you made it very clear madame,3
that depends on the tip,3
thats no business thats a social injustice,3
well thats my business madame,3
why,3
may i have your bags madame,3
what do you want,3
here please,3
i will do my best,3
please dont waste my time comrade do your duty goodby,3
how can i make myself clear it is difficult to express but id rather not go to foreign countries any more please comrade let me stay here let me finish my work i am in the rhythm of it now i dont want to go away i dont want to be sent into that foreign atmosphere again it throws one out of gear let me finish my work i have concentrated everything in it please dont make me go,3
i dont understand,3
i am sorry i dont want to overstep my position but please dont send me,3
that is for me to decide comrade yakushova,3
i appreciate the confidence you show in me but i must ask you to entrust someone else with this mission i should hate to interrupt my present work i am positive that my survey is more important than finding out whether three of our comrades have been drinking some extra glasses of champagne,3
yes leaving immediately,3
you want me to go to constantinople,3
it gives details which couldnt be invented naturally i want to verify it and thats why i need you,3
oh they shouldnt do such things are you sure this report is correct,3
as soon as our representatives go to a foreign country they seem to lose all sense of balance if i told you whats going on in constantinople right now you wouldnt believe it those three have been sitting there for six weeks and havent sold a piece of fur this anonymous report was sent me they are dragging the good name of our country through every caf??? and night club here how can the bolshevik cause gain respect among the moslems if your three representatives buljanoff iranoff and kopalski get so drunk that they throw a carpet out of their hotel window and complain to the management that it didnt fly,3
may i ask what has happened,3
i havent either but ive heard about them you must realize it was only on the strength of your paris report that i sent them to constantinople without that i never would have trusted them on a mission as important as the fur deal,3
no,3
well comrade have you heard from your friends kopalski buljanoff and iranoff,3
thank you,3
cigarette,3
please sit down,3
may i ask why,3
well comrade i am afraid you will have to turn over that work to someone else,3
i need very little sleep we must be extremely careful what goods we take in exchange i have already started a survey of our most urgent needs,3
thats marvelous you must have worked day and night dont you ever sleep,3
yes,3
you mean you have finished the whole investigation,3
yes it does,3
does this include the products of the far eastern provinces,3

this morning three soviet agents arrived i overheard a telephone conversation with mercier the jeweler your highness they are going to sell them,3
alexis do you know what you are saying,3
they are here your jewels here in paris,3
why do you bring this up after so many years,3
i remember one birthday of his majesty our beloved czar i had the honor of being on guard at the summer palace i still see you bending before his majesty you wore your diadem and a necklace your face seemed to be lighted by the jewels,3
my jewels,3
no madame something of the utmost importance it concerns your jewels,3
what is it rakonin did you lose your job,3
your highness forgive this intrusion but,3
how do you do my friend,3
your highness,3
but sir well have to start over from the beginning we dont have the staff to,3
for christs sake it soils my mothers memory do you think i want the whole goddamn world to see my mother like this raising a dirty mouth,3
you dont need to check the tape i know what i said,3
we could check the tape again sir,3
never i never said that about jews,3
you did say it sir,3
youre lawyers how can you let this shit go by look this nixon cant say this,3
then tell richardson to fire him,3
sir if i may echo my concern,3
they cant impeach me for bombing cambodia the president can bomb anybody he wants,3
sir the charges are serious first abuse of power second obstruction of justice third failure to cooperate with congress and last bombing cambodia,3
yeah well i own the fucking casino,3
thats helms hes sang froid a worldclass poker player,3
well he certainly isnt acting like it,3
hes nervous sir hes heard youre looking for a new director,3
well see about that,3
frankly sir it stinks i have no access im lucky helms lets me have a staff,3
hows the job coming bob,3
then his office will be fine,3
no his office i want a very private conversation i dont want to be bugged,3
he told me to take you to his conference room,3
so lets go,3
uh hes rushing back from his tennis game sir,3
where the hell is he,3
mr president i dont know what to say as soon as we learned from the secret service you were en route the director was notified he should be here any minute,3
good you know how i feel about loyalty im not going to let any of my people go to jail that i promise you the important thing is to keep this away from haldeman and ehrlichman im trusting you to do that john i have complete confidence in you,3
i understand that sir,3
john you dont want to start down that road i remember what whittaker chambers told me back in 48 and he was a man who suffered greatly he said on the road of the informer its always night this is beyond you or even me its the country john its the presidency,3
im not going to be the scapegoat for this haldeman and ehrlichman are in just as deep as me,3
nobody knows more about this thing than you do john,3
you want me to put it all in writing over my signature,3
we have nothing to hide but the only flaw in the plan is that theyre not going to believe the truth that is the incredible thing,3
no we have nothing to hide,3
hes right maybe its time to go to the hangout route john a full and thorough investigation weve cooperated with the fbi well cooperate with the senate what do we have to hide,3
i mean who the hell cares about this pennyante shit goldwater put it right he said well for christs sake everybody bugs everybody else we know that its the coverup not the deed thats really bad here if only mitchell could step up and take the brunt of it give them the hors doeuvre and maybe they wont come back for the main course thats the tragedy of all this mitchells going to get it in the neck anyway its time he assumed some responsibility,3
i agree its ridiculous but,3
jesus everything is a crisis among the upper intellectual types the softheads the average people dont think its much of a crisis for christs sake its not vietnam no ones dying here isnt it ridiculous,3
sir i still dont think uh we can contain it anymore theres a cancer on the presidency and its growing with every day that,3
you say john cut our losses and all the rest but suppose the thing blows and they indict bob and the others jesus youd never recover from that john its better to fight it out instead and not let people testify,3
im still not confident we can ride through this some people are going to have to go to jail hunts not the only problem haldeman let me use the 350000 cash fund in his safe to make the payments ehrlichman had a role a big role in the ellsberg breakin and im uh i think its time we begin to think in terms of cutting our losses,3
we could get a million dollars we could get it in cash i know where it could be gotten,3
uh huh,3
we could get that,3
uh i would say these people are going to cost a million dollars over the next two years,3
how much do you need,3
either it goes to mitchell or it comes here,3
mitchell mitchells family,3
i like that thats a solution,3
hunt has nothing to lose now pardon all of them nobodys going to investigate a crime for which the criminals have already been pardoned,3
what,3
executive clemency,3
pay him pay him what he wants,3
he says if he doesnt get it right away hes going to blow us out of the water and he means it ever since his wife died in the plane crash hes been over the edge,3
son of a bitch,3
mr president hunt wants more money another hundredandthirty thousand,3
then what about this washington post crap woodwind and fernstein,3
siricas just trying to force one of them to testify but theyre solid,3
so what about those watergate clowns john this fuck siricas crazy thirtyfiveyear sentences there were no weapons right no injuries there was no success its just ridiculous,3
excia theres no such thing as excia john theyre all ivy league establishment is he one of these guys with a beef against us,3
the bigger problem i see is this guy who was arrested mccord james mccord he headed up security for the committee to reelect he turns out to be excia,3
john sooner or later sooner i think you are going to learn the lesson that has been learned by everyone who has ever gotten close to richard nixon that hes the darkness reaching out for the darkness and eventually its either you or him look at the landscape of his life and youll see a boneyard,3
howard youll serve no more than two years then hell pardon you,3
im one of his people the cubans are his people and were going to jail for him,3
to protect his people,3
thats not the question john the question is why is he paying,3
how the hell do you have the temerity to blackmail the president of the united states,3
in richard nixons long history of underhanded dealings he has never gotten better value for his money if i were to open my mouth all the dominoes would fall,3
is it,3
ill bet he would,3
the president would like to know if that was the last payment,3
yes i got the money,3
i was sorry to hear about your wife,3
so you tell mitchell,3
dick nixon saying im sorry thatll be the day the whole suit of armord fall off,3
eight words back in 72 i covered up i was wrong im sorry and the american public wouldve forgiven him but we never opened our mouths john we failed him,3
christ we created frankenstein with those fucking cubans,3
they went after castro in some crazy way it got turned on kennedy i dont think the p knows what happened but hes afraid to find out its got him shitting peach pits,3
yeah,3
i think he means the kennedy assassination,3
i figured that out,3
its a code or something,3
you think this is just about politics,3
the old man plays politics harder than anybody else,3
sure they did stuff but nothing like this bob forget watergate the breakins the enemies list you got an attempted firebombing at the brookings institution planting mcgovern stuff on the guy that shot wallace trying to slip lsd to jack anderson,3
how so,3
hes wrong you know about kennedy lbj truman,3
cause he hates you its worse when you get it from someone you trust,3
why me,3
you do it,3
whos gonna tell mitchell,3
yeah i knew it i knew it from 69 on and i said it all along didnt i,3
yeah sullivan thinks henrys leaking hes the one,3
its the fall of the roman empire are you blind and were putting fig leaves on the statues,3
lets not forget theyre just kids they dont vote,3
anyway they had to take her to bellevue maybe shell stay this time,3
it was her wrist and it was through a plateglass door,3
we are covering up for some petty stupid shit there are things i can say when other people say them theyd be lies but when i say them nobody believes me anyway,3
executive privilege will make it look like were covering up,3
no youre not youre going to claim executive privilege and youre going to stonewall it all the way plead the fifth amendment i dont give a shit they cant force the presidents people to testify,3
sir bob and i are gonna have to testify before earvins committee,3
i dont know i dont know i just know weve made too many enemies,3
and what am i supposed to do just sit here and watch them coming closer eating their way to the center lyndon bugged so did kennedy fdr cut a deal with lucky luciano christ even ike had a mistress whats so special about me what about lyndon he could make a couple of calls to the hill and shut this whole thing down did anyone talk to him,3
itll never wash pardoning them means were guilty the people the press will go nuts,3
forget it ehrenbergs paid three times that much,3
what about england,3
my point exactly somebody had to die before his shit got in the paper fucking kennedys get away with everything do you see me screwing everything that moves for christs sake i did what the new york times editorial page said we should do i ended the war i got salt i with the russians i opened china so why are these cocksuckers turning on me because they dont like the way i look where i went to school,3
he got pretty burned at chappaquiddick,3
i end the longest war in american history and they keep harping on this chickenshit you know whos behind this dont you its teddy kennedy he drowns a broad in his car and he cant run for president,3
no no hes our only star right now hed go crying straight to the press hed crucify us the sonofabitch get someone from our staff on his ass tap his phones i want to know everyone he talks to,3
i would personally enjoy doing that sir,3
looks like he talked to joe kraft and to the times told them he was dead set against the bombing that you were unstable claims he has to handle you with kid gloves,3
no you didnt bob,3
the hardcore four million nixon nuts arent gonna go for it theyll say i sold out to the communists,3
the countrys loving it,3
well no place where they speak english that way he can always say he was misquoted,3
hes begging for a meeting chief he wants to go overseas for awhile,3
yeah good old spiro well better him than me what the hell is he but an insurance policy,3
hes in the dumps sir agnew every time you have him attack the press they give it back to him in spades hes become the most hated man in america,3
sir theres dead american kids here lets say we dont apologize for kent state but maybe we could have a national prayer day,3
the soldiers were provoked the students started it for christs sake,3
as long as hes got secret files on everybody i dont want em used against us what about the cia helmss done nothing for us i want to see him,3
i thought the gloves were off,3
we cant touch hoover,3
no i can do this because ive spent my whole career building anti communist credentials,3
excuse me are you talking about recognizing china mr president that would cost us our strongest support,3
i will not go down as the first american president to lose a war going into cambodia bombing hanoi bombing laos it buys us time so we can get out and give the south vietnamese a fighting chance,3
is the war worth it is it worth a oneterm presidency because i think right now thats what were looking at,3
why not,3
i dont know if id go that far sir,3
oh i suppose you wouldve just let them take over these arent fraternity pranks john its anarchy a revolution,3
we should set up a cuban defense fund on this take care of all of them,3
no sir,3
this is not a joke john,3
uh weve never done this before sir how do we pay in hundreds do you fill a black bag full of unmarked bills,3

mitchell,3
marthas an idiot shell do anything to get johns attention if mitchelld been minding the store instead of that nut martha we wouldnt have that kid magruder runnin some thirdrate burglary was he smoking pot,3
jesus through a window,3
mitchells out of his mind now martha just put her head through a plateglass window,3
jesus did mitchell know,3
colson doesnt know about it hes pure as a virgin on this one its just not clear the burglars knew what they were looking for they were heading to mcgoverns office later that night,3
that smell i mean everybody suffered so much their sons killed they need to sacrifice something yknow appease the gods of war mars jupiter i am that blood general i am that sacrifice in the highest place of all all leaders must finally be sacrificed,3
sir,3
it came over from vietnam you know,3
i know it well sir,3
they smelled the blood on me this time al i got soft you know that rusty metallic smell,3
its gone no one will ever find out whats on it,3
you mentioned the bay of pigs several times sooner or later theyre going to want to know what that means theyre going to want to know what was on that gap,3
i dont know anything about that,3
three days before on the june twentieth tape the one with the eighteenminute gap,3
thats right,3
sir you talked about opening up the whole bay of pigs thing again,3
there is nothing in that statement the president cant explain,3
we cant survive this sir they also have you instructing dean to make the payoff to hunt,3
how do you see this,3
that was civil war,3
lincoln used it,3
the army,3
and if i stay,3
if you resign you can keep your tapes as a private citizen you can fight them for years,3
its the supreme court sir you dont get around it,3
can we get around this al,3
sir the deadline is today,3
its totally out of context i was protecting the national security i never intended,3
your lawyers feel its the smoking gun,3
so,3
june twentythird 72 sir the part thats underlined your instructions to haldeman regarding the cia and the fbi,3
im afraid we have another problem mr president,3
victory at sea al henry the pacific theatre christ you can almost feel the waves breaking over the decks,3
i had no knowledge of the coverup until john dean told me about it on march twentyfirst and i did not intend that payment to hunt or anyone else be made,3
hes completely lost touch with reality,3
an action that will at last once and for all show that what i knew and what i did with regard to the watergate breakin and coverup were just as i have described them to you from the very beginning,3
the hell he will fire him too if you have to go all the way down to the janitor at the justice department fire the sonofabitch and,3
richardson wont do that hell resign,3
but he works for the attorney general only richardson can fire him,3
cox fire him,3
who,3
a dozen i got half of em elected i still got the south and goldwater and his boys ill take my chances with the senate,3
about a dozen,3
for what,3
congress is considering four articles of impeachment sir,3
who the fuck does cox think he is i never made a dime from public office im honest my dad died broke you know the sonofabitch went to law school with jack kennedy the last gasp of the establishment they got the hell kicked out of em in the election so now they gotta squeal about watergate cause we were the first real threat to them in years and by god al we would have changed it changed it so they couldnt have changed it back in a hundred years if only,3
can the president afford to ignore a subpoena,3
let em try i appointed three of those bastards im not giving em my tapes,3
this could trigger the impeachment theyll go to the supreme court next,3
its the presidents personal property i will never give up my tapes to a bunch of kennedyloving harvard democrat cocksuckers,3
these state department jerks bill dont understand you got to electrify people with bold moves bold moves make history like teddy roosevelt tr rushing up san juan hill small event but dramatic people took notice,3
thats what theyre doing,3
exactly weve got to take the war to them hit em where it hurts right in the nuts more assassinations more killings right al,3
night al,3
i dont have a pistol,3
you know al men in your profession you give em a pistol and you leave the room,3
youre all set sir just push this button good night mr president,3
damn right and theres still a helluva lotta people out there who wanna believe thats the point isnt it they wanna believe in the president,3
no sir you did not,3
youve never been a greater example to the country than you are now sir but but you need to get out more sir and talk to the people no one i know feels close to you,3
theres no secrets here al,3
may i say something mr president,3
not like the others dean mccord the rest we never got our side of the story out al peopleve forgotten i mean fuck you mr president fuck you tricia fuck you julie and all that shit just words but what violence the tear gassing the riots burning the draft cards black panthers we fixed it al and they hate me for it the double dealing bastards they lionize that traitor ellsberg for stealing secrets but they jump all over me cause its nixon theyve always hated nixon,3
at least mitchell stood up to it,3
i trusted mitchell it was that damn big mouth wife of his,3
mr hoover was a realist,3
yknow al if hoover was alive none of this wouldve happened he wouldve protected the president,3
go on,3
sorry,3
its marked also theres june twenty third and this year march twenty first those are the ones,3
this is june twentieth,3
sir six bodies,3
there can be no whitewash at the white house two wrongs do not make a right i love america god bless america and god bless each and every one of you,3
no,3
more light chief,3
for gods sake when does this end,3
helms wants iran or there might be problems all of his old cia buddies are over there making a fortune off the shah,3
townsend gave us 300 grand belgiums not worth more than 100 150,3
put townsend in belgium its available,3
i promised iran to townsend,3
hell give us the documents but i think he should be offered the ambassadorship to iran then hell go without a whimper,3
what about the documents he promised,3
i was wondering whats such dynamite in this bay of pigs story although it was clearly effective because all of a sudden it was no problem for helms to go to the fbi and try to put a lid on watergate,3
when i met with him he said,3
how,3
we could leverage helms,3
its helms its got to be,3
weve got to turn the faucet off on this thing its out of control you might burden just me with this in the future,3
hell be looking in his toilet bowl every time he pulls the chain,3
you played it perfectly sir cocksucker hes going to think twice before he leaks again,3
worrying whether someone said something nice about them all shortterm frivolous bullshit ben bradlee worrying about teddy kennedy liking him,3
beating out the other papers chasing girls,3
you know why theyre turning on me theyre not serious about power thats why theyre playing with power theyre forgetting the national interest in the old days people knew how to hold power how to set limits they wouldnt have torn this country apart over a thirdrate burglary all they care about now are their egos looking good at cocktail parties,3
why would they who the hells sulzberger anyway their parents are gold traders from eastern europe they buy things they come to jew york city and they buy up things one of the things they buy is the new york times and you know what be proud because theyll never trust you sir because we speak for the average american,3
right they dont trust they dont trust america,3
because theyre not americans,3
we ought to fire his whining ass right now when hes on top you know what itll set the right example for the rest of this administration,3
my god my god he talked to the new york times,3
so that explains his press notices working both sides of the fence jewboy henry always trying to get his nobel prize get laid,3
this could be it this could be it four long years,3
congratulations boss a great victory the madman theory wasnt so crazy after all,3
the presidency wont protect us bob were beyond politics now,3
sir,3
but even the presidency isnt enough anymore,3
i believe youre right boss,3
you know they all miss the point probably our biggest achievement as an administration when its all said and done isnt china or russia its pulling out of vietnam without a right wing revolt,3
let him finish bob,3
gentlemen i think its about time for us to be getting to the airport,3
dont let it lose us the rightwing vote,3
the blacks are lost the schwartzes are gone,3
youre talking too much about black africa henry its killing us with the rednecks,3
the jews arent the middle henry theyre the far left,3
wait till the maitais wear off,3
and his staff come on the copy they were filing from china was great,3
the beast a nineteenyearold kid she understands the nature of the beast she called it a wild animal,3
sir,3
she understood something its taken me twentyfive fucking years in politics to understand the cia the mafia the wall street bastards,3
what,3
she got it bob a nineteenyearold college kid,3
dont forget the most important thing in your life is your relationship with your maker dont forget to be on gods side,3
we really must go mr president,3
its okay bob were just rapping my friends and i we actually agree on a lot of things,3
mr president,3
yeah weve got to get our vice president off the golf course and back there on the college circuit thats top priority,3
but hell this is nothing compared to venezuela when i was vice president ike sent me down there like a blocking back they threw rocks broke out our windows almost overturned the car read six crises bob boy pat was brave,3
its the parents fault really,3
dont forget the south sir the west filled with the good football colleges straight kids theres more of em with you than against you not like these mudmutts,3
theres a poison in the upper classes bob theyve had it too soft too many cars too many color tvs,3
probably flunking nothing to do except come down here and meet girls henrys out there with them,3
get that little fucker great tackle reminds me of my days at whittier most of these kids are useless,3
run em over,3
no a little deficit wont hurt jesus theyre serious whyre we stopping,3
and weve got the economic guys at five the dow lost another 16 points theyre going to want a decision on the budget sir are we holding the line on a balanced budget,3
i tell you the soldiers were provoked now stop this pussyfooting around dead kids how the hell did we ever give the democrats a weapon like this i mean if cambodia doesnt work well bomb hanoi if we have to,3
never complain never explain john,3
these kids are being manipulated by the communists like chambers and hiss,3
sir,3
money follow the money,3
well one way or the other kent state is not good we have to get out in front of this thing the pr is going to murder us,3
they had us bugged christ he had everybody bugged yeah he was gonna support me in 68 but he was also threatening me that was hoover hed give you the carrot but hed make damn sure the stick went right up your ass,3
if they didnt tell kennedy about track 2 how did hoover find out,3
i didnt want him to get the credit he said id stabbed him in the back called me a twobit grocery clerk from whittier,3
you never told him,3
hed just found out about track 2,3
because he didnt even know about it the cia never told him they just kept it going it was like it had a life of its own like a kind of beast that doesnt even know it exists it just eats people when it doesnt need em anymore two days after the bay of pigs kennedy called me in he reamed my ass,3
alright but why if kennedy is so clean in all this didnt he cancel track 2,3
because because dick helms knows too much if anyone in this country knows more than i do its hoover and helms you dont fuck with dick helms period,3
so you wanted castro dead everybody wanted castro dead if hunt and the others are cia why dont we just throw this back in the cias lap let richard helms take the fall,3
and not just hunt frank sturgis all those cubans all of them in the watergate they were involved in track 2 in cuba hunt reported to my military aide but i met with him several times as vice president thats what worries the shit out of me i dont know how much hunt knows or the cubans,3
jesus,3
he didnt veto it i ran the white house side the mob contact was johnny roselli one of the cia guys was that jackass howard hunt,3
before eisenhower approved that,3
the first assassination attempt was in 60 just before the election,3
chile congo guatemala cuba wherevers theres a need for an executive action capability theres a track 2 in cuba track 1 was the bay of pigs invasion track 2 it was our idea we felt the invasion wouldnt work unless we got rid of castro so we asked ourselves who else wants castro dead the mafia the money people so we put together track 2,3
i dont understand track 2s chile,3
yeah but roselli wasnt just any gangster he was the gangster who set up track 2 in cuba,3
what that he knew johnny roselli hoover knew a lot of gangsters,3
he wasnt protecting me he was putting me on notice,3
i unlike senator kennedy have a plan to end the war but not for peace at any price but peace with honor,3
cue the crowd go to the womans group get the bald guy hes great,3
no,3
dick you dont have to make a statement herb covered it for you,3
where are they,3
the bastard if id called his shot on cuba i wouldve won he made me look soft,3
meanwhile what happens to the country,3
an open invitation for mr khrushchev to become involved in latin america we would lose all our friends in latin america,3
hes treading water dont mention khrushchev,3
i think i think thats the sort of very dangerous and irresponsible suggestion that helping the cuban exiles who oppose castro would uh not only be a violation of international law it would be,3
he wouldnt do the makeup said it was for queers,3
when we consider the lineup of the world we find there are 590 million people on our side 800 million on the communist side and 600 million who are neutral the odds are 5 to 3 against us,3
yes sir ill talk to helms and uh whats our press position on this watergate thing what do i tell ziegler to tell them,3
no no not tonight dont let her in here i have too much to do,3
ill talk to helms oh pat asked if youre coming to the residence for dinner tonight,3
this isnt a moral issue bob we have to keep our enemies at bay or our whole program is gonna go down the tubes the fbi is filled with people who are pissed that i put gray in and not one of their own vietnam china the soviet union when you look at the big picture bob youll see were doing a hell of a lotta good in this world lets not screw it up with some shitass thirdrate burglary,3
sir,3
i suppose you thought the presidency was above this sort of thing,3
because the president says it is my job is to protect this country from its enemies and its enemies are inside the walls,3
how is this national security,3
its got nothing to do with justice its national security,3
the only problem with that sir it gets us into obstruction of justice,3
christ youre right gray makes jerry ford look like mozart just have helms call him helms can scare anybody,3
hell need a pretext hell never figure one out for himself,3
pat grayll do anything we ask him thats why i appointed him,3
yes sir but do you think grayll go for it,3
just do what i say bob,3
the bay of pigs that was kennedys screwup how does that threaten us,3
play it tough thats the way they play it and thats the way were going to play it dont lie to helms and say theres no involvement but just say this is sort of a comedy of errors bizarre without getting into it say the president believes its going to open up the whole bay of pigs thing again tell helms he should call the fbi call pat gray and say that we wish for the sake of the country dont go any further into this hankypanky period,3
all right,3
weve got to turn off the fbi you just go to the cia bob and tell helms that howard hunt is blackmailing the president tell him that hunt and his cuban friends know too damn much and if he goes public it would be a fiasco for the cia hell know what im talking about,3
thats right and its more a problem for ehrlichman he fixed hunt up with the phony cia ids but what else does hunt have on us,3
uh no one of course is going to see these tapes but,3
you approved that before the fact because i went over it with you but,3
bob did i approve the ellsberg thing you know im glad we tape all these conversations because i never approved that breakin at ellsbergs psychiatrist or maybe i approved it after the fact someday weve got to start transcribing the tapes,3
no keep trini out of this chotiners too old and for gods sake keep colson out its time to baptize our young counsel that means dean can never talk about it attorneyclient privilege get to it and dean you stay close on this,3
should we talk to trini about paying these guys or maybe chotiner,3
well work on it i say we cut ourselves loose from these clowns and thats all there is to it,3
national security priority restricted and controlled secret,3
national priority,3
how about a comint classification we put it on the huston plan even the designation is classified,3
security is not strong enough,3
but sir youre covered no one here gave orders to break into the damned watergate were clean its only the ellsberg thing and if that comes out its national security,3
silence,3
but what are we paying him for,3
what do you mean sir,3
howard hunt jesus christ you open up that scab and you uncover a lot of pus,3
our own intelligence capability to fix the leaks,3
well why not,3
we were working on china,3
fucking hell,3
it was right after the pentagon papers broke they went in to get his psychiatric records,3
i did,3
yes you approved it sir,3
i had nothing to do with that was he in the ellsberg thing,3
definitely colson had him trying to break into bremers apartment after bremer shot wallace to plant mcgovern campaign literature,3
on the list of horribles i know what he is and i know what he tracks back to you say he was involved in the plumbers,3
howard hunt is working for the white house no shit this is goddamn disneyland since when,3
he works for colson he used him on the pentagon papers were trying to figure out when he officially stopped being a white house consultant after the arrest he dumped his wiretapping stuff into his white house safe,3
apparently he was using some campaign cash that was laundered for us through mexico the fbis onto it we could have a problem with that,3
whats liddy got,3
well you know sir hes a nut he used to work here with the plumbers and now hes running this watergate caper you remember his plan to firebomb the brookings using cubans as firemen he wanted to buy a damned fire truck magruder thinks hes just nutty enough to go off the reservation,3
that fruitcake what about him,3
we feel the bigger concern is gordon liddy,3
contributions it was a legal contribution who the hell authorized this colson,3
its possible they were looking for evidence of an illegal howard hughes donation to the democrats so the democrats couldnt make an issue of your hughes money,3
their fourth,3
it was just a fishing expedition apparently it was their fourth attempt at the dnc,3
but obrien doesnt even use that office the democratsve moved to miami theres nothing there,3
evidently to install bugs and photograph documents,3
they did what i dont understand whyd they go into obriens office in the first place,3
thou must find thy peace at the center richard strength in this life happiness in the next,3
what about happiness mother,3
its meant to make us stronger thou art stronger than harold stronger than arthur god has chosen thee to survive,3
did he have to die for me to get it,3
its a gift richard this law school is a gift from your brother,3
thou must,3
i cant,3

harold may have lost touch with his bible but thou must never lapse,3
yes mother,3
because harold tests thy fathers will is no reason to admire him let harolds worldliness be a warning to thee not an example,3
why me,3
richard come with me would you,3
youre not gonna quit on me are you harold,3
relax dick its just me the deserts so beautiful isnt it i want to go home dick time to go home,3
harold can i get you anything,3
mom expects great things from you,3
go to law school mom and dadll be able to afford it now,3
what,3
hey youll be able to do it now,3
id rather get a whipping than have another talk with her anything but a talk with her,3
oh no harold he doesnt respond well to humor maybe if you talk to mother she can,3
i said i didnt need a free ride i need a suit,3
whatd you say,3
what do you think he said in life theres no free ride,3
whatd he say,3
black irishman very moving turning and turning in the widening gyre the falcon cannot hear the falconer things fall apart the center cannot hold mere anarchy is loosed upon the world and everywhere the ceremony of innocence is drowned the best lack all conviction while the worst are full of passionate intensity but it ends so beautifully ominous what rough beast its hours come round at last slouches toward bethlehem to be born yes this country stands at such a juncture,3
no,3
you must be familiar with my favorite poem by yeats the second coming,3
no they make me sick they smell like death i had two brothers die young but let me tell you there are worse things than death there is such a thing as evil,3
flowers are continual reminders of our mortality do you appreciate flowers,3
i never thought jack was ready for the presidency but i would never never consider his death was awful an awful thing for this country do you ever think of death mr helms,3
so president kennedy thought,3
cuba would be a small price to pay,3
by offering cuba to the russians as a consolation prize,3
but if we were able to separate china from russia once and for all we can we could create a balance of power that would secure the peace into the next century,3
this is an extremely dangerous direction mr president terrible consequences can result from such enormous errors in judgement,3
is that why you and kissinger are negotiating with the chinese,3
cia policy the cia has no policy mr helms except what i dictate to you i try to adjust to the world as it is today not as you or i wanted it to be ten years ago,3
but it has never been the policy of this government to accept that and it is certainly not cia policy,3
mr helms weve lived with communism in cuba for ten years,3
it is not my practice to spy on the president doctor kissinger manages to convey his innermost secrets to the world at large on his own,3
not if you have spies in the white house it isnt your job,3
my job unpleasant sometimes is to know what others dont want me to know,3
are you tapping kissinger,3
i dont think we can treat this as a formality mr kennedy made a verbal promise to the russians not to invade cuba but you authorized dr kissinger to put this in writing,3
well well lodge a formal protest,3
we have recent intelligence that a soviet nuclear submarine has docked at cienfuegos,3
yes,3
mr castro,3
what,3
it will take a little time but ill order a search for your papers though it does raise a disturbing issue,3
yes and you will give general cushman full access,3
and of course i accept im flattered and i want you to know i work for only one president at a time,3
firing you mr helms wouldnt do any good of course youll continue as dci youre doing a magnificent job,3
and me,3
the president would support a reasonable request for an increase,3
current levels may not be sufficient,3
i promised the american people peace with honor in southeast asia that could take time two maybe three years in the meantime your agency will continue at current levels of funding,3
not if i give you all the cards,3
im not jack kennedy your agency is secure,3
president kennedy threatened to smash the cia into a thousand pieces you could do the same,3
im interested in the documents that put your people together with the others all of them,3
diem trujillo lumumba guatemala cuba its a shame you didnt take similar precautions dick,3
yes,3
youre referring of course to chairing the special operations group as vice president,3
yes it involves some old and forgotten papers things i signed as vice president i want the originals in my office and i dont want copies anywhere else,3
is there something else thats bothering you mr president,3
screw congressional oversight i know damn well going back to the 50s this agency reports what it wants and buries what it doesnt want congress to know pay close attention to this,3
im sure you realize this is a very tricky area mr president given our charter and the congressional oversight committees,3
then find something and i want these leaks stopped jack fucking anderson the new york times the state department i want to know whos talking to them,3
of course weve tried but so far weve come up with nothing that,3
youre correct im concerned these students are being funded by foreign interests whether they know it or not the fbi is worthless in this area i want your full concentration on this matter,3
i suppose mister president youre unhappy that we have not implemented your domestic intelligence plan but,3
i didnt choose him as my deputy mr president you did,3
robert cushman is a lieutenant general in the marine corps the deputy director of the cia and this is what you use him for,3
and so shall i arrange some coffee would you general cushman,3
my friends call me mister president,3
im honored dick that youve come all this way out here to virginia to visit us at last,3
if things remain as they are hes got the antiwar vote,3
ummm,3
would you walk with me down to the paddock id like to look at the horses for the eighth,3
little bobby,3
kennedy never hell fry in hell for what he did to me but nixon doesnt know that which is why im gonna have to remind him he needs us a helluva lot moren we need him,3
its between nixon and a kennedy again edgar who do you want,3
not joaquin you idiot nixon did you hear what he said in oregon about me having too much power,3
edgar think twice he works in the kitchen,3
i want to see him tomorrow clyde,3
hes lying clyde always has thats why nixons always been useful hold still and take your hand off your hip,3
what do you think this plan is edgar a nuclear attack,3
it wont as long as im here,3
this damned tie will you help me edgar churchill used to say to me if you want your own history written properly you must write it yourself all right edgar but just dont let it come back to haunt me,3
no one your property it would prove your case why do you think kissingers taping your calls for history his word against yours and right now hes got the records,3
yeah you do id be bugging myself edgar whod get the tapes,3
i always get my man,3
jesus id like to book him into a psychiatrists office he comes in here ranting and raving dumping his crap all over the place could you prove it edgar,3
hes obsessed with his own image he wants his nobel peace prize a little too much as the late doctor king proved even an ape can win a prize with good press,3
kissinger,3
well you have cia people all over the place helms has seen to that then theres kissingers staff kissinger himself i believe maybe the leaker,3
who do you think is behind it,3
that was a mistake the white house was full of kennedy people then it still is,3
we took his system out,3
johnson had the same damned problem till he bugged his own office,3
we cant keep a goddamn secret in this government edgar theyre stealing papers right out of his office,3
dont listen to em dont quit remember kennedy bobby and king were against the war where are they now dont give em a goddamn inch on the war president johnson bombed laos for years and nobody knew or said a thing how the hell the times ever got ahold of this ellsberg stuff is a disgrace,3
the little bastards think they can ruin tricias wedding day by dancing naked in the reflecting pond,3
remember what lenin said in 1917 mr president the power was lying in the streets just waiting for someone to pick it up the communists have never been closer now is the time to go back to the old themes the ones that made you president let the communists know youre onto them,3
there must be a quartermillion out there edgar theyve been at it now for a year young kids just like tricia i dont know do you think they have a point edgar maybe this whole damned system of government is,3
the old queen did it on purpose,3
you asked if you could count on my support as long as i can count on yours,3
yeah well as i said edgar,3
i know,3
or hell steal it like his brother hes a mean little sonofabitch edgar he had the irs audit my mother when she was dying in a nursing home,3
it could be 60 all over again edgar bobbys got the magic like a goddamn rock star they climb all over each other just to touch his clothes hell ride his brothers corpse right into the white house,3
youll win the nomination,3
i know youve been very careful not to thats why im concerned,3
i never met the man,3
yes your old friend from cuba,3
roselli johnny roselli,3
im trying to spare you an embarrassment johnny roselli is on his way back here,3

it was the poorest lemon ranch in california i can tell you that my father sold it before they found oil on it,3
i wont tell him if you wont,3

and whose fault is that if wed won in vietnam,3
jack were not living in the same country you and i knew in 46 our people are just not gonna sacrifice in major numbers for war we cant even get em to accept cuts in their gas tanks hell the arabs and the japanese are bleeding the shit out of our gold,3
it looks like to me were gonna lose the war for the first goddamned time and dick goddamn it youre going along with it buying into this kissinger bullshit detente with the communists detente it sounds like two fags dancing,3
well you sure been chock full of surprises so far mister president,3
its me or wallace jack wallaces third party is only going to help mcgovern i need your support,3
so whats this about dick,3
nobodys gonna beat kennedy in 64 with all the money in the world,3
that sonofabitch kennedy is coming back down here tomorrow dick were willing to put up a shitpot fulla money to get rid of him more moneyn you ever dreamed of,3
only if kennedy dumps johnson,3
dick these boys want you to run theyre serious they can deliver the south and they can put texas in your column that wouldve done it in 60,3
gentlemen i tried i told kennedy to go into cuba he heard me and he made his decision i appreciate your sentiments ive heard them from many fine cuban patriots but its nothing i can do anything about now its a long drive back to dallas tonight and trini and i have got an early flight tomorrow to new york,3
agreed,3
hell kennedys pissed cuba away to the russians and he dont know what the hell hes doing in vietnam these are dangerous times dick especially for business,3
hes all business aint he trini dick we couldve had our own goddamn lawyers handle this deal we brought you down here cause we wanted to talk to you,3
by the way jack this looks like a pretty straightforward transaction to me but we should get into it soon just take a few minutes maybe up at the house,3
her names sandy,3
shes quite pretty,3
i know for a fact that the one with the big tits is a republican and shed do anything for the party,2
well see about that,3
like you said jack im just a new york lawyer now,3
well uh trini and i have an early plane we were hoping to get back to new york in time for,3
party aint started yet dick got these gals coming over to the ranch later for a little private thing yknow theres some fellows i want you to meet,3
thanks jack you sure throw a helluva party,3
dont be too proud never be too proud to go on your knees before god,3
not at all this is not going to leak is it,3
uh i hope this doesnt embarrass you,3
yes my mother used to pray a lot its been a long time since i really prayed lets pray henry lets pray a little,3
uh not really you mean on my knees,3
do you ever pray you know believe in a supreme being,3
you have many friends and admirers,3
dont be stupid the world needs you henry you always saw the big picture you were my equal in many ways youre the only friend ive got henry,3
if they harass you i too will resign and i will tell the world why,3
that depends who writes the history books im not a quitter but im not stupid either a trial would kill me thats what they want but they wont get it,3
they will understand sir to be undone by a thirdrate burglary is a fate of biblical proportions history will treat you far more kindly than your contemporaries,3
yes you always had a good sense of timing henry when to give and when to take how do you think mao brezhnev will react do you think this is how theyll remember me henry after all the great things you and i did together as some kind of of crooks,3
oh god im going to throw up,3
because people have got to know whether or not their president is a crook well i am not a crook i have never made a dime from public service,3
can you imagine what this man would have been had he ever been loved,3
yeah,3
mr nixon it is possible for even a president to go too far,3
resent it all you want henry but youre in it with the rest of us cambodia ellsberg the wiretaps you put in the president wants you to know you cant just click your heels and head back to harvard yard its your ass too henry and its in the wind twisting with everyone elses,3
i had nothing to do with that sir and i resent any implication,3
that doesnt matter now henry the point is you might lose some of your mediadarling halo if the press starts sniffing around our dirty laundry,3
idiotic yes i suppose it was,3
i i heard something it sounded idiotic,3
all kinds of shit would come out like the ellsberg thing you knew about that henry didnt you,3
but it must be done your government is paralyzed,3
housecleaning it would be ugly henry really ugly,3
jews and negros dont win elections henry better to hang them around the democrats necks,3
youll pick up the middle on this one the jews and negros,3
we have to entertain the possibility,3
thats right and if necessary ill drop the big one,3
this is a major coup gentlemen our own state department doesnt even know and if it leaks out of here tonight,3
mr president this cannot be breathed especially to our secretary of state that cretin rogers the chinese would never trust us again the only way i emphasize only way to pull this off is in secret,3
this will get me a second term damn it without risk theres no heroism theres no history i nixon was born to do this,3
thats what geopolitics is about the whole world linked by self interest you tell me ron how the hell i can explain that on television to a bunch of simpleminded reporters and weeping fucking mothers,3
exactly yes mr president that is my contention,3
thats triangular diplomacy gentlemen,3
no one understands even my own men what do you think the communists respond to honesty liberal guilt soulwringing crap fathers on tv crying hell no i understand the communist mind ive studied it for thirty years they grasp realpolitik better than any of us right henry,3
exactly sir that is your historical contribution to lead boldly in an era of limits,3
what i think is theyre cowards their opposition represents the cowardice of the eastern establishment they dont realize as you do mr president that the communists only respect strength and they will only negotiate in good faith if they fear the madman richard nixon,3
i didnt ask what your staff thinks henry what do you think,3
well as you know most of my staff have weighed in against this incursion they believe it will fail to achieve anything fundamental militarily and will result in crushing criticism domestically,3
but they all got it back again didnt they we should have lunch sometime,3
churchill degaulle disraeli they all went through the pain of losing power,3
finally someone whos noticed im a great admirer of yours too mr nixon you are an unusual politician we share a mutual idol six crises sounds like a page from churchill,3
as the old alliances crumble,3
were gonna hit him so hard he looks like everything thats sick and evil about the eastern establishment you and your plumbers are gonna find dirt on this guy lets see him going to the bathroom in front of the american public and when we finish with him theyll crucify him,3
theres no other choice,3
alright henry were gonna go your way crush this ellsberg character the same way we did hiss,3
and what do we get for it gobs and gobs of bullshit gossip nothing someone is leaking weve got to stop the leaks henry at any cost do you hear me then we can go for the big play china russia,3
who are you talking to like this you insignificant shit,3
hes turned into a drug fiend he shot people from helicopters in vietnam he has sexual relations with his wife in front of their children he sees a shrink in la hes all fucked up now hes trying to be a hero to the liberals if he gets away with it everybody will follow his lead he must be stopped at all costs,3
no henry i dont,3
he was he was we taught a class together at harvard but you know these backstabbing ivy league intellectuals they cant,3
its your people who are leaking to the times wasnt this ellsberg a student of yours at harvard he was your idea why are you suddenly running for cover,3
i beg your pardon,3
fuck it he doesnt like me john its your fault henry,3
here tim tim im as frustrated as you henry but dont you think this ones a democrat problem they started the war it makes them look bad,3
mr president we are in a revolutionary situation we are under siege black panthers weathermen the state department under rogers is leaking like a sieve and now this insignificant little shit ellsberg publishing all the diplomatic secrets of this country will destroy our ability to conduct foreign policy,3
how a fat man gets so many girls,3
secret mr chairman,3
fung pi ive only managed to change a few things around the city of beijing i want to know your secret,3
but your writings have changed the world mr chairman,3
what a waste of time my writings mean absolutely nothing,3
you know mr chairman at harvard i used your writings in my class,3
how did he do that all those kids why do they hate me so much,3
i dont know he made me see the stars,3

of course,3
just uh you know,3
i was asleep mr president what can i get you,3
the real war is in us history is a symptom of our disease,3
civil war is always the cruelest kind of war,3
youre too modest nixon youre as evil as i am were both from poor families but others pay to feed the hunger in us in my case millions of reactionaries in your case millions of vietnamese,3
i was the lesser of two evils,3
you know i voted for you in your last election,3
that has the added virtue of being true,3
mr chairman there is an old saying the enemy of my enemy is my friend,3
dont ever trust them they never tell the truth or honor their commitments vietnamese are like russians both are dogs,3
we know youve taken a great risk in inviting us here,3
looks can be deceiving,3
i must say you look very good mr chairman,3
kissingers misunderstood he pretends to be a liberal for his establishment friends but hes even tougher than i am,3
how about kissinger along with him,3
were gonna get rid of him allende i mean just as fast as we can hes on the top of the list,3
what are you going to do about this allende fellow nationalizing our businesses in chile you gonna send kissinger down there,3
free if youre the president,3
so hows the food over there in china mr nixon,3
i came down here to close a deal for studebaker,3
you just came down here for the weather right mr nixon,3
yes well gentlemen i promised my wife im out of politics,3
sure id like to offer condolences,3
get off that that leads nowhere you should offer condolences to the families of those kids,3
that was a long time ago,3
it broke my heart when harold died,3
youre doing the right thing dick dont let em shake you,3
they were throwing rocks john just rocks they dont think i feel but i feel too much sometimes i just cant let a whole policy get dominated by our sentimentality,3
it wasnt your fault the soldiers were just kids too they panicked,3
my brother harold was about the same age as those kids john tuberculosis got him,3
you all right,3
how do you know that john did we try are we just giving up like the rest of em whats hoover found for gods sake,3
this isnt 48 dick theyll never buy it,3
shit the press doesnt care about the facts cronkites sticking it to me its their first big hit on richard nixon,3
one of the fathers was on the tv saying my child was not a bum and its playing like gangbusters hell hoover told me one of the girls was a nymph,3
jesus christ,3
four two boys two girls and eight wounded,3
how many,3
dont worry ill use the old nixon charm on her,3
you need her dick in 60 she was worth five six million votes,2
uh wait,3

lets get out of here its too painful i hate it we went bowling last weekend next weekend were going to the zoo whoever said there was life after politics was full of shit,3
thatll be the day,3
youre the one who should be in politics john youre tougher than i am you never crack,3
the jewboys a harvard whore with the morals of an eel sells himself to the highest bidder,3
well he seems to have bought kissinger,3
goes to show you all the moolah in the world cant buy you a brain,3
rockys full of shit no way hes going to get nominated west of the hudson with a new wife hes gonna be drinking scotches in retirement at some goddamn country club with the rest of the republicans,3
what the hell i love her and shes great in bed,3
talks all day too how the hell can you put up with her john,3
its a thing she does she talks at night,3
you mean smashed she called up at midnight last week talking a bunch of crap pat cant stand her,3
sorry dick shes a little tipsy,3
when they know youve got something to protect thats when they fuck you,3
hiss was protecting his wife ive always believed that,3
but i wouldnt have if hiss hadnt lied about knowing chambers the documents were old and out of date like these pentagon papers the key thing we proved was that hiss was a liar then people bought it that he was a spy its the lie that gets you,3
and dick beat the shit out of them,3
you remember john in 48 no one believed alger hiss was a communist except me they loved hiss just like they loved this ellsberg character east coast ivy league he was their kind i was dirt to them nothing,3
the lie,3
you know this kinda thing you gotta be brutal a leak happens the whole damn place should be fired really you do it like the germans in world war ii if they went through these towns and a sniper hit one of them theyd line the whole goddamned town up and say until you talk youre all getting shot i really think thats what has to be done i dont think you can be mr niceguy anymore,3
it was illegal what he did,3
but its not bottomline gonna change a goddamn thing john the question is how do we screw ellsberg so bad it puts the fear of god into all leakers,3
we can prosecute the new york times go for an injunction,3
any information you have edgar the sonofabitch is not gonna steal from me again can you back me up on this can i count on your support,3

you all know me im one of you i grew up a stones throw from here on a little lemon ranch in yorba linda,3
give me a break mary,3
but change always comes slowly ive withdrawn more than half the troops im trying to cut the military budget for the first time in thirty years i want an allvolunteer army but its also a question of american credibility our position in the world,3
come on man vietnam aint germany it doesnt threaten us its a civil war between the vietnamese,3
that man up there lived in similar times he had chaos and civil war and hatred between the races sometimes i go to the lincoln room at the white house and just pray you know the liberals act like idealism belongs to them but its not true my family went republican because lincoln freed the slaves my grandmother was an abolitionist it was quakers who founded whittier my hometown to abolish slavery they were conservative bible folk but they had a powerful sense of right and wrong forty years ago i was looking as you are now for answers but you know ending the war and cleaning up the air and the cities feeding the poor my mother used to feed hobos stopping over at our house none of it is going to satisfy the spiritual hunger we all have finding a meaning to this life,3
what you have to understand mr nixon is that we are willing to die for what we believe in,3
right right i used to play a little ball myself at whittier of course they used me as a tackling dummy,3
ernie davis,3
the orangemen now theres a football program jim brown and that other tailback the one with the blood disease,3

and you should keep your nose out of another mans omelette its no big deal betty,3
you should get the order you want,3
its fine mind your own meal,3
i thought you said the eggs werent,3
why dont you go back to doing something youre good at like that lonelyhearts column ill take a refill there betty,3

i dont think i am,3
wesley didnt even want to come up here he warned me but i insisted i have to ask you bettyare you crazy,3
i wouldnt have put it quite that way but,3
so all this really was because of that soap opera my son is dead because you came out here to be with that doctor a fake doctor,3
yes not the actor though the doctor i think,3
did did you really come here because you love this guy,3
when a roman general knew a battle was lost hed throw himself on his sword,3
whatre you saying,3
betty i dont wanna shrivel up alone in some stinking prison no way ive got some professional pride and i dont want anybody else to get the credit for taking me out,3
id rather not,3
ahh its too late anyway its too late listen i could shoot my way out maybe take one of them with me if youd gimme my gun back,3
this is really awkward,3
wait betty you still havent answered me,3
i better go check on them,3
if we went out that window right now wed have a chance,3
wait a second i am not the reason youre here i was minding my own business living a perfectly boring life until you came along,3
youre sorry youre the reason were here,3
im sorry,3

yes but id sort of like to put that behind me now,3
i thought you were a garbageman of humanity or something,3
i know i borrowed it from your grandparents because i i it doesnt matter dont worry theyre fine look i used to feel that same way said practically those same words sitting at night in a foxhole in korea ive chased you across the country betty and i come to find out were a lot more alike than youd think,3
i wrote that when i was twelve whered you get that,3
no one is honey here listen to this if who i am and who i hope to be should meet one day i know they will be friends now thats beautiful,3
i dont feel that no i just im not really who you think i am,3

thirtytwo,3
wait let me get this out i like the symphony walks in the rain sunsets animals and children i read passionately and i like to discuss things im basically conservative but flexible ive been involved in the death of thirty two people but i can live with that because the world is lighter by thirty two pieces of shit excuse my language,3
umm i dont think that,3
im appreciably older than you but my health is good i take care of myself and i got some money socked away youd never have to work again thats for sure id treat you like a queen,3
sure you could probably have any thing you wanted somebody as beautiful and stylish as yourself and you dont even realize it,3
i am,3
i never meet people like you im a garbageman of the human condition i deal with trash mostly people willing to trade any part of themselves for a few more minutes of their rotten lives but you youre different,3
to see you,3
well if youre not going to slit my throat whyd you come up here,3
damn life is strange i had you figured for this coldblooded calculating bitch not that i didnt admire you for it,3
drugs god no im totally against drugs,3
so you werent involved with him in his pathetic attempt to diversify were you mixed up in the drugs betty,3
i have no idea what he was mixed up in it was always something,3
you really didnt have anything to do with what del was doing did you,3
ive got a pretty good idea youre here to kill me so kill me you want me to be afraid but im not i dont care who you are or why you two killed my husband,3
do you know why im here,3
i i know what you are,3

our penguin right,3
to put us back together again when we fall,3
yeah to watch the world go by,3
thats really what we all need right someone to sit up on the wall with us,3
thats sad isnt it he had to sit on that wall all by himself he deserved to have somebody,3
but humpty dumpty was alone,3
maybe distant cousins they did have that egg shape in common,3
thanks they werent related to humpty dumpty were they tweedle dum and tweedle dee,3
youre really doing a great job here josie i like your can do attitude,3
im thinking when im home,3
when are you going to open your eyes,3
thanks josie this wasnt as bad as i thought,3
i shouldnt say that because im your teacher,3
you have to say that youre my teacher,3
thats okay its nice to have someone to talk to,3
i dont know and you know whats scarywhen you get older it just gets more confusing ive spent the last ten years with women who are basically all wrong for me you know what i shouldnt be talking about this stuff with you,3
why do you do that,3
id like to tell you that we all grow out of it but thats a lie some of us will always be rattling cages,3
i know,3
boys,3
i dont have to say that,3
you have to say that youre my student,3
you do seem to have passion in the classroom,3
god i would love to think im an interesting teacher i mean i had maybe one or two teachers in high school who had any passion at all,3
thats what makes you interesting as a teacher,3
okay this is okay smooth can i ask you something do you think i tell too many stories in class,3
dont look down,3
yoooooow,3
of course i remember everything from your class,3
you remember that story,3
oh right the spiderman incident,3
actually its more the plunging head first into the crowd part that gets me,3
youre afraid of the ferris wheel,3
im gonna tell you something here and i hope it doesnt undermine my position as an authority figure im a little afraid of heights,3
are youscared,3
thank you,3
this seat taken,3
josie youre different when you speak in class i can tellyou actually feel the words in here theyre alive likeeurdora welty talked about the word it moon how for her it was like a concord grape that grandpa took off his vine and gave to me to suck out of its skin,3
thanks wow thatsreally nice to hear,3
josie you owe it to yourself to go for your writing youre a natural,3
oh no no no no no see my family we dont go to college we just go right into sheep herding,3
thats crazy ill get you some applications,3
college havent really thought about it,3
so what are you thinking for college,3
thank you,3
your writing its amazing josie youre really talented and far less depressing than dorothy parker,3
oh i dont think so,3
hey josie hold on youve been hiding something from me,3
well im definitely seventeen and now definitely late,3
because seventeenyearolds do not like writers from the 30s they dont even like people in their 30s,3
sure why,3
true i guess she hadnt completely given up hope are you sure youre seventeen,3
but i think she wanted to be happy thats why she wrote i mean she was still writing about love right,3
not the happiest of souls art is a form of catharsis and love is a permanent flop,3
i love the way she writes,3
you like her,3
dorothy parker,3
sorry forgetful,3
whoa deja vu,3
im josie geller i think the school would probably be pretty comfortable with you calling me that josie,3
hi everyone i don t think weve met im sam coulson although for some reason the school has this thing about not letting you guys call me sam,3
thats what im saying,3
the poem i knew he liked the poem billy prince is asking me to the prom,3
i dont know,3
why,3
billy prince is asking you to prom,3

nancy,3
theres only one manand its time for him to talk,3
who would know where they were hidden,3
they burned him to death in his boiler room but they were smart enough to hide the remains,3
the question is what happened to freddys body,3
all right whoever she is ill admit she seems to know more about krueger than i do,3
ive heard crazier things this week,3
assuming your mysterious nun in right,3
bullshit getting yourself killed wont do the kids any good besides we do have a choice,3
dont you think i know that i dont have any choice,3
youre not going in thats exactly what he wants as long as youre on hypnocyl its the only way he can get to you,3
theres nothing we can do its out of our hands,3
what are we going to do,3
anything,3
take it slowly remember this is a dream anything is possible,3
this isnt possible and even if it iswhat the hell am i doing here did you drag me in here too,3
we made it neil we made it,3
everybody take five,3
we can try again,3
breathe deeply and relaxstarting with your toes relax everything until theres no tension left in your bodies none at all keep following the pendulum,3
take us there kristen,3
okay were going to try a little group hypnosis,3
remember open mind,3
you sound like peter pan,3
i can do that,3
only if youre willing to put aside everything youve learned and trust me can you do that,3
try me,3
the truth,3
for what,3
then maybe youre ready,3
im running out of answers a patient sleepwalks out of a security ward up to a tower with no access a girl alone in a room dies by jumping six feet straight up into a television set nothing makes sense anymore,3
stop blaming yourself,3
cmon lets get out of this rain,3
doesnt matter,3
to who,3
were gonna try,3
do you think we can get the hypnocyl in by tomorrow,3
i cant believe i just did that,3
im sorry nancy the answer is no,3
do you you told me theyre survivorsand they are but how much longer they survive is up to us,3
so do i,3
i used to be like them neil i know what theyre going through,3
dream deprivation is nothing to fool around with you have no business taking it yourself,3
just until we get things under control,3
you want me to prescribe an experimental psychoactive drug to a bunch of suicidal teenagers,3
thats right,3
with hypnocyl,3
all right then lets eliminate the symptom for the time being,3
the nightmares are nothing but a symptom of their real problems,3
thats what i know,3
thats a new one is that what theyre teaching now at stanford,3
what if i told you your patients are in real physical danger from their dreams,3
okayi believe in different levels of conciousness that sort of thingbut if youre into ufos or atlantis youve lost me,3
im serious,3
ive been to pittsburgh does that count,3
it was neil do you believe in other realities,3
sounds like a rough time,3
my father an iwell the family just seemed to fall apart,3
sorry,3
my mothers dead died in her sleep,3
most authentic mexican food in springwood which isnt saying much your parents still live around here,3

oh god,3
we lost a kid about a month ago to fairview i dont know where he got the razorbut he cut off his own eyelids to stay awake,3
anything,3

freddy krueger he was a child murderer before he died after he died he became something worse six years ago freddy killed my friends he almost killed me i thought i got rid of him but i guess he was too strong,3
who is he,3
hey everybody has bad dreams,3

thats precisely what they need some uninterrupted rem sleep to release all this negative energy,3
you cant theyll be defenseless against their dreams,3
well begin sedation tonight starting with him,3
the byproduct of guilt psychological scars steaming from moral conflicts and overt sexuality,3

they used to keep a spare key,3
how do we get in,3
in there charlie penny owns the place we knew no one would ever find it im not even sure i can find it again,3
you must find the remainsand bury them in hallowed ground,3
you said something beforeabout laying him to rest,3
the bastard son of a hundred maniacs some say he was murdered though no body was ever found,3
freddy,3
that girl was amanda krueger her child,3
my god,3
a young girl on the staff was accidentally locked in here over the holidays the inmates managed to keep her hidden for days she was rapedhundreds of times when they found her she was barely aliveand with child,3
the whole facility was shut down in the forties wasnt it some kind of scandal,3
purgatoryfashioned by the hands of men twisted lost souls the worst of the criminally insane were locked away in here like animals,3
this wings been closed for years what was this place,3
i beg your pardon,3
only one thing can save the children the unquiet spirit must be laid to rest it is an abomination to god and man,3
i couldve saved them,3
i come from time to time when im needed,3

okay groups in session straight talk only in this room,3
elizabeth we dont need any outside help i know these kids i dont want some hotshot taking chances with them just so she can get published,3
shes been doing groundbreaking research on pattern nightmares,3
frankly i dont understand why some grad school superstar is being treated like a seasoned pro,3

im delighted,3

well a shot at it,3
im sorry you think you deserve the brownie,3
wait a minute what about me,3
oh no one no one just some guy from the past i dont know what hes doing here bit of an awkward situation,3
who was that rather difficult chap you were talking to on the way up,3
and then i right,3
tomorrow will be soon enough,3
so i ask you when youre going to tell everyone and you say,3
i said im not listening and i think looking at something that firm you and your droopy little excuse for an arse would be welladvised to keep quiet,3
no but seriously its not fair so many tragic young teenagers with anorexia and that girl has an arse she could perfectly well share round with at least ten other women and still be begbottomed,3
im not listening,3
god thats an enormous arse,3
oh stop showing off,3
we have to ive got to be in new york on thursday,3
we are living in cloudcuckooland well never get this done today,3
right right so thats fairly good on the high side have you tried the nuts,3
fifteen million dollars,3
oh splendid well done hows the pay in movies i mean last film you did what did you get paid,3
films mainly,3
i see friends from university clever chaps been in the business longer than you theyre scraping by on seven eight thousand a year its no life what sort of acting do you do,3
well they can be,3
splendid im actually in the stock market so not really similar fields though i have done some amateur stuff pg wodehouse you know farce all that ooh careful there vicar always imagined its a pretty tough job though acting i mean the wages are a scandal arent they,3
im an actress,3
so tell me anna what do you do,3
thats very good news the readers of horse and hound will be absolutely delighted,3
yes im pretty sure i would,3
and what would you say,3
i hoped there might be but no im assured there arent,3
okay fine fine good decision,3
i live in notting hill you live in beverly hills everyone in the world knows who you are my mother has trouble remembering my name,3
i see that reality is a real no isnt it,3
with you im in real danger it took like a perfect situation apart from that foul temper of yours but my relatively inexperienced heart would i fear not recover if i was once again cast aside which i would absolutely expect to be there are too many pictures of you everywhere too many films youd go and id be well buggered basically,3
the truth is,3
yes thats fine of course i you know of course ill just be getting along then nice to see you,3
can i just say no to your kind request and leave it at that,3
thats fine theres always a pause when the jury goes out to consider its verdict,3
sorry about that,3
you expect me to tell the truth about my life to the most indiscreet man in england,3
but yesterday that actor asked you who i was and you just dismissed me out of hand i heard you had a microphone i had headphones,3
yes the thing is i have to go away today but i wondered if i didnt whether you might let me see you a bit or a lot maybe see if you could like me again,3
you were saying,3
whats the thing,3
i actually had it in my apartment in new york and just thought youd but when it came to it i didnt know how to call you having behaved so badly twice so its been just sitting in the hotel but then you came so i figured the thing is the thing is,3
okay well thank you i dont know what its for but thank you anyway,3
no dont open it yet ill be embarrassed,3
thank you shall i,3
i thought id give it to you,3
oh no its all nonsense believe me i had no idea how much nonsense it all was but nonsense it all is well yesterday was our last day filming and so im just off but i brought you this from home and,3
fine everything much the same when they change the law spike and i will marry immediately whereas you ive watched in wonder awards glory,3
well how have you been,3
yes im sorry i had to leave i didnt want to disturb you,3
you disappeared,3
hello,3

i was going to ring but i didnt think youd want to,3
i only found out you were here yesterday,3
this is certainly ah,3
you really dont get it this story gets filed every time anyone writes anything about me theyll dig up these photos newspapers last forever ill regret this forever,3
well you know its just one day todays papers will all have been thrown away tomorrow,3
excuse me,3
i mean todays newspapers will be lining tomorrows waste paper bins,3
youre right of course youre right its just that ive dealt with this garbage for ten years now youve had it for ten minutes our perspectives are different,3
thats not true and wait a minute this is crazy behavior cant we just laugh about this seriously in the huge sweep of things this stuff doesnt matter,3
and remember spike owes you an expensive dinner or holiday depending if hes got the brains to get the going rate on betrayal,3
i dont want a goddamn cup of tea i want to go home,3
now stop stop i beg you calm down have a cup of tea,3
who knows it may even help business buy a boring book about egypt from the guy who screwed anna scott,3
thats spectacularly unfair,3
you can stay calm its the perfect situation for you minimum input maximum publicity everyone you ever bump into will know well done you you slept with that actress weve seen the pictures,3
i know i know but just lets stay calm,3
as far as theyre concerned i do and now tomorrow therell be pictures of you in every newspapers from here to timbuktu,3
you do,3
this is such a mess i come to you to protect myself against more crappy gossip and now im landed in it all over again for gods sake ive got a boyfriend,3
really the entire british press just woke up this morning and thought hey i know where anna scott is shes in that house with the blue door in notting hill and then you go out in your goddamn underwear,3
thats not true,3
i do your furry friend thought hed make a buck or two telling the papers where i was,3
i dont know what happened,3
how do you think im doing,3
how are you doing,3
jesus,3
undressed like this yes,3

oh,3
youre lovelier this morning than you have ever been,3
her most famous part men went to bed with the dream and they didnt like it when they woke up with the reality do you feel that way with me,3
who was gilda,3
rita hayworth used to say they go to bed with gilda they wake up with me do you feel that,3
actually i cant think really let me just have a quick look,3
but theyre oddlooking theyre for milk your mums got them you must have seen a thousand of them whats the fuss about,3
more than that actually when you think about it you know meatloaf has a very nice pair,3
no seriously i mean theyre just breasts every second person in the world has got them,3
well,3
what is it about men and nudity particularly breasts how can you be so interested in them,2
oh god yes im sorry,3

what,3
wow,3
no no wait i thought you were someone else i thought you were spike im delighted youre not,3
okay,3
oh please sod off,3

definitely ths is important stuff,3
would you be tempted to go for a slightly better bottom than your own,3
i could have a stunt bottom yes,3
you have a stunt bottom,3
definitely you may show the dent at the top of the artists buttocks but neither cheek in the event of a stunt person being used the artist must have full consultation,3
you actually have clauses in your contact about nudity,2
the thing thats so irritating is that now im so totally fierce when it comes to nudity clauses,3
big feet large shoes,3
no whats that,3
you know what they say about men with big feet,3
yes always have had,3
youve got big feet,3
yes happiness wouldnt be happiness without a violinplaying goat,3
with a goat playing a violin,3
i do it feels like how being in love should be floating through a dark blue sky,3
you like chagall,3
and i think the book is the poorer for it,3
yes i mean you never get anyone in wings of a dove having the nerve to say inform the pentagon that we need black star cover,3
im sure youd be great in henry james but you know this writers pretty damn good too,3

yes theyre shifting the whole outfit much more towards the trading side and of course i was total crap,3
no,3
get fired,3
i just want to say to tony dont take it personally the more i think about things the more i see no rhyme or reason in life no one knows why some things work out and some things dont why some of us get lucky and some of us,3
cest la vie were lucky in lots of ways but surely its worth a brownie,3
no not true,3
oh god oh god oh goddy god,3
yup,3

yes,3
anna scott,3
quickly quickly talk very quickly what are you doing here with anna scott,3
yes i think that one may be,3
this painting isnt the original is it,3
tony what do you think,3
good decision all actresses are mad as snakes,3
why not all that awaits me at home is a masturbating welshman,3
do you want to stay,3
oh no this is just getting worse i am going to find myself 30 years from now still on this couch,3
i mean i loved you you were terribly funny but all that kissing my ears,3

bella this is anna,3
dont even ask,3
hes cooking guinea fowl,3
hiya sorry the guinea fowl is proving more complicated than expected,3
is miss scott staying here,3
bloody hell this is fun,3
it was sort of sweet actually i mean i know shes an actress and all that so she can deliver a line but she said that she might be as famous as can be but also that she was just a girl standing in front of a boy asking him to love her,3
well you know anybody saying they want to go out with you is pretty great isnt it,3
what,3
thats nice,3
yes sort of,3
but she said she wanted to go out with you,3
well obviously its me isnt it i work in the city in a job i dont understand and everyone keeps getting promoted above me i havent had a girlfriends since puberty and well the long and short of it is nobody fancies me and if these cheeks get any chubbier they never will,3
bernie,3
wheres bella,3
and we intend to use them,3
if anyone gets in our way we have small nuclear devices,3
im not saying its a bad thing in fact i think its something we should take pride in im going to give the last brownie as a prize to the saddest act here,3
shame,3
having you here anna firmly establishes what ive long suspected that we really are the most desperate hot of underachievers,3

but ringo starr doesnt look anything like topol,3
thats right topol,3
topol,3
would be exciting if someone famous did come into the shop though wouldnt it do you know this is pretty incredible actually i once saw ringo starr or at least i think it was ringo it might have been that broke from fiddler on the roof toppy,3

no dont think i do,3
dont give a damn about the famous girl,3
i believe i have,3
so youve laid the ghost,3
but i wish to make it clear ive turned a corner and henceforward intend to be impressively happy,3
theres an understatement there are dead people on better form,3
yes i feel i must apologize to everyone for my behavior for the last six months i have as you know been slightly down in the mouth,3
any more announcements,3
is it someone we know,3
wait a minute im your brother and i dont know anything about this,3
no really one of them marries me and then leaves me quicker than you can say indiana jones and the other who seriously ought to have known better casually marries my best friend,3
thats not fair,3
i think you have forgotten what an unusual situation you have here to find someone you actually love wholl love you the chances are always miniscule look at me not counting the american ive only loved two girls in my whole life both total disasters,3
shes perfect perfect,3
well,3
really,3
every time but dont despair i think i have the solution to your problems,3
buggered,3

does flintstone mean anything to you,3
i think she said her name was flintstone,3
what,3
try flintstone,3
absolutely no idea remembering one names bad enough,3
which was,3
well it was genuinely bizarre she said hi its anna and then she said call me at the ritz and then gave herself a completely different name,3
what did she say,3
absolutely not,3
right no one else,3
ahm lets see ahm no gone completely oh no wait there was one from your mum she said dont forget lunch and her legs hurting again,3
who were the ones you didnt write down from,3

two thats it,3
yeh i wrote a couple down,3
so any messages,3
groovy you should do more of this stuff,3
no they were prescription so i could see all the fishes properly,3
theres something wrong with the goggles though,3
right vicious circle and then i was like rooting around in your things and found this and i thought cool kind of spacey,3
there never will be you know unless you actually clean your clothes,3
ahm combination of factors really no clean clothes,3
just incidentally why are you wearing that,3
hi,3
hey,3
yes she is fairly fabulous,3
imagine somewhere in the world theres a man whos allowed to kiss her,3
well there you go on for a video fest tonight ive got some absolute classic,3
its not yogurt its mayonnaise,3
theres something wrong with this yogurt,3
good luck,3
thanks great wish me luck,3
well yes thats perfect well done,3
wouldnt want that okay just one more,3
yes she might think you dont have true love on your mind,3
cool huh,3
point taken,3
yes might make it hard to strike a really romantic note,3
well wait for it first theres this one,3
what are the choices,3
thats right im at last going out on a date with the great janine and i just want to be sure ive picked the right tshirt,3
this is important in comparison to lets say whether they should cancel third world debt,3
even he hey you couldnt help me with an incredibly important decision could you,3
wait a minute she took your grandmothers flowers,3
fabulous,3
how was she,3
oh sure of course,3
do you mind me not saying its a rather distressing disease and the name of the hospital rather gives it away,3
im sorry which hospital,3
no theyre for my grandmother shes in a hospital nearby thought id kill two birds with one stone,3
oh right,3
yes,3
are you sure you,3
three,3
which floor,3
well ideally when i went back to the desk youd remove the cadogan guide to bali from your trousers and either wipe it and put it back or buy it see you in a sec,3
okay what if i did have a book down my trousers,3
right well then we have something of an impasse i tell you what ill call the police and	what can i say if im wrong about the whole bookdownthetrousers scenario i really apologize,3
i havent got a book down my trousers,3
the one down your trousers,3
what book,3
so i saw you put that book down your trousers,3
so,3
weve got a security camera in this bit of the shop,3
what,3
bad news,3
yes,3
excuse me,3
no mister harding that is not true,3
is it true mcmurphy killed two attendants and escaped yesterday,3
yes mister harding,3
yes thank you miss ratched since our last meeting i have been reflecting quite seriously on the nature of my problem naturally im referring to the capacity to obtain the necessary results in order to obtain no no to personify the very existence of that relationship regardless of the function regardless of the function we will confront the question of yes yes the question of existence relationship function confront yes confronting us in the moment of deepest crisis yes the crisis of our souls of our souls which i am trying to fully understand the problem the problem not to shut ourselves off but somehow somehow to understand fully our capacity to obtain to personify the question existence depends depends on the question to reflect to reflect,3
yes mister harding,3
i mean the other day you made an allusion to my wife and the possible sexual problems we might be having i know that to be the case but the way in which you broached it if thats your idea of teaching me something,3
no secrets mister harding lets get it all out in the open,3
have you ever speculated mister harding that you are impatient with your wife because she does not meet your mental requirements,3
i can only speculate as to the reasons why,3
why,3
yes that is correct,3
and yet you suspect her,3
no miss ratched,3
but you have no proof,3
yes miss ratched this is correct,3
am i to take it that there isnt a man among you who has an opinion concerning this matter mister harding youve stated on more than one occasion that you suspected your wife of seeing other men,3
he also thinks he may have given her reason to seek sexual attention elsewhere but he didnt say how he has been heard to say to his wife i hate you i dont ever want to see you again youve betrayed me so does anyone care to touch upon this further,3
yes thats perfectly correct,3
at the close of fridays meeting we were discussing mister hardings problem concerning his wife mister harding stated that his wife made him uneasy because she drew stares from men on the street is that correct mister harding,3
mister washington,3

very well what is it youre proposing mister mcmurphy,3
yeah itll satisfy me,3
what the hell does that have to do with it this is an important event and i want a vote on it,3
let me pose a question to the group do any of you feel that mister mcmurphy is perhaps imposing his personal desires on you too much,3
yeah yeah the hell with that crap the world series is goin on right now an thats therapy also,3
mister mcmurphy the purpose of this meeting is therapy group therapy,3
jesus christ the man doesnt want to talk so get off his back an lets get on to some new business,3

the hell with the schedule you can get back to the schedule next week when the series is over what i want is a vote on it right now,3

yeah,3
just a minute mister mcmurphy,3

jesus that old nurse sure wants my ass in a sling dont she,2
im afraid not,3
come on doc you must be kiddin,3
yes that may be so but in making a careful study of your past record along with your behavior since you arrived here my feeling is that you are not mentally ill and it is going to be my recommendation that you be returned to pendleton where they are better equipped to handle your case,3
shoot doc the only one im disturbing is that old nurse and her fixed ways thats all,3
yes well miss ratched feels that youre a disturbing influence on the other patients,3
come on doc you know as well as i do whats been comin down in that loony bin,3

just fine doc in fact i think i mightve put on a couple of pounds since i got here,3
how are you feeling,3
it is worth considering miss ratched,3
well i was turnin this dilemma over in my head when i happened to hit on that old tub room out there an i said to myself mcmurphy i said that place would make a great second day room a sort of game room for the young fellas whadaya think doc,3

well youre here for a ninetyday observation period mister mcmurphy id like you to understand you are here on a court order and we are responsible to the state so id like your cooperation,3
no this is my first trip doc,3
ah it seems you have no other psychiatric history mister murphy,3
doc what can i tell ya,3
the doctor at the prison states dont overlook the possibility that this man may be faking psychosis to escape the drudgery of the work farm what do you say to that,3
thats correct doc,3
arrested on an assault charge five times,3
i dont doc,3
well according to the warden at pendleton you were a disturbing influence on others it appears that there is a potential in him for instigating a revolt among the other inmates what do you think of that report,3
well ya know doc doesnt it say so there,3
yes ah do you know why youre here,3

your hair is perfect,3
my hairs kind of a mess isnt it,3
yes,3

yes im crazy you have driven me crazy no one in their right mind would go to this much trouble to win over someone as insane as you did it ever even for one second occur to you how much work it was to set all this up how many arrangements had to be made how many players had to be coordinated,3
rational love is not rational are you crazy,3

well i mightve found him again if i hadnt left rome to make this pointless trip down here with you,3
i sabotaged it youre the one who lost him remember,3
youre the reason i never met him you knew it was the thing i most wanted in life and you sabotaged it,3
and i cant believe you are so stubborn and so blind as to let some stranger some phantom youve never even met destroy it,3
i cant believe you did that,3

because i know where he is,3
why not,3
who says i dont love him,3

look peter i dont hate you but what we had was an illusion mutual wishful thinking we both wanted to believe it for awhile but it was all founded on a lie,3
there must be something i can do something i can say to make this up to you just tell me what it is ill say it ill do it i dont want you to hate me,3
hes a podiatrist pain is your bodys way of telling you something is wrong your toe is trying to tell you not to do it,3

why are you asking me this,3
you didnt answer my question,3
he wants to marry me doesnt he,3
does he love you,3

larry did you rent a car,3
hes gone he told me what happened he just left for the airport,3
im fine have you seen peter,3
i dont know ive just been thinking maybe this destiny thing is more of a doityourself operation maybe the things that are meant to be are the things we want badly enough to fight for,3
what about larry,3
and larry,3
well i ought to be getting home anyway the kidsll be back from camp soon the house is probably a mess,3
oh,3
actually no theres not going to be a wedding,3
well i realized if youre getting married youre gonna be needing the maid of honor right,3
i didnt expect you back so soon,3
uh huh,3
kate is that you,3
so i guess ive got a wedding to go to,3
so,3
when you couldve found one in america,3
i came all the way to italy in search of a weasel,3
yup,3
i spent my whole life waiting for a creep,3
yes he is,3
hes a jerk,3
or maybe itll turn him back into a toad,3
maybe if i kiss him ill feel it,3
i thought this was supposed to be the one guy in the world you wouldnt need to change,3
maybe i can change him,3
no i think maybe youve been right i think i may have been too critical in the past,3
and he is living proof,3
no ones perfect kate,3
not only is he a mommas boy and a fascist he says nuculear and irregardless,3
uh huh okay well be there how is he anyway,3
kate thank god youre there i need help,3
faith im kidding is this how you plan to get what you want from life when you finally find it you turn and run away from it,3
my god youre right,3
it means youre a completely worthless excuse for a human being and the fates have all conspired to make you miserable,3
what if he doesnt like me,3
whatareyoudoing,3
is damon bradley here,3
joan collins stayed here,3
hes down in someplace called positano peter says we can make it there by morning,3

peter found him,3
ill be back before you leave,3
im sure and kate thank you for coming thank you for being such a good friend,3
you sure youll be okay,3
no no you go ahead,3
im just not ready to go home quite yet thats all,3
what,3
who said i was going,3
the last dead end in a long series of dead ends that i am relieved to finally be leaving behind may as well start packing our cabs gonna be here in an hour,3
peter peter was a mistake an imposter,3
what about peter,3
yeah well obviously it wasnt meant to be ive got fortyeight hours i can still make it home in time to marry dwayne and try to forget any of this ever happened,3
and a fortune teller,3
it was a ouija board remember,3
i know but,3
i thought you were the one who didnt think i shouldve come in the first place,3
so youre just quitting just like that,3
why do they read kids fairy tales in the first place children are very impressionable you know,3
okay a lot of bad luck but that means the odds are probably in your favor now this is no time to give up,3
a little bad luck,3
so youve had a little bad luck,3
because ive been kidding myself because i realized you were right from the beginning this whole thing was just a wild goose chase,3
why,3
packing,3
sightseeing whatre you doing,3
hi whereve you been,3
hiiii,3
men have ways,3
but how could he know he only just met me,3
yeah sociopaths theyre able to figure out what you want them to be and then they act like that,3
dont be silly hows a psychiatrist gonna find him,3
no like a psychiatrist,3
like a detective,3
i think its time we got some professional help,3
i meant about my idea,3
that was really sweet,3
and then we rent a truck or a car either one and we set up a loudspeaker and we drive through the surrounding areas and we page him,3
and then what faith,3
okay heres what i think we find out what all the subway stops for that train are the subway systems really not that big in rome we could narrow it down and,3
well nobody can say we didnt try,3
good luck,3
what,3
faith,3
right okay its meant to be right this is it,3
faith so far youve trailed the man halfway around the globe at this point i dont think another fifteen feet is gonna tip the scales,3
right right okay you dont think hes gonna think im too aggressive,3
nope,3
is he looking at us,3
hes sitting in the fourth booth down on the left hand side with his back to us hes wearing a navy jacket if you turn around you can see part of his right elbow,3
oh my god where,3
hes heeeeeerrre,3
okay okay you join him but first will you ask if hes here,3
not if you dont count the sixth grade,3
sure you did,3
i never even got to be single,3
because im the one whos single,3
well how come were always looking for guys for you,3
i told you if he sees me here with another guy hes gonna think im here with another guy i just dont want to send any confusing signals,3
so whats in a name i wanna join him i dont see why we cant join him,3
youve travelled over six thousand miles and now youre gonna play hard to get,3
i sort of wanted to wait to see if maybe hed notice me first,3
youre right at least that way you could spend the rest of your life blaming your parents instead of yourself smile,3
all of the sudden im feeling kind of nervous god i hate blind dates why couldnt we just have arranged marriages in america,3
whats she saying,3
i dont know i just asked her if she knew him and all of the sudden,3
what did you say to her,3
right my brother,3
her brother,3
anna im faith you dont know how happy i am to meet you you see im trying to find someone and,3
polo,3
larry bought himself cologne,3
he went out and bought himself mens cologne the other day did i tell you that,3
and you know what i thought then kate i thought i hope someday i have somebody who loves me that much i still hope that,3
that was a long time ago,3
you know when larry and i got married i thought we were so lucky we found each other so early people talk about spending their lives together how many of them really get to but maybe i was wrong maybe sooner or later everything wears out,3
course he does,3
you think he misses me at all,3
i dont know kate i just said that im sorry im just on edge im afraid were losing him,3
so what exactly is larrys side of the story anyway,3
sorry,3
well you dont have to get snippy with me,3
you expecting somebody you know,3
nothing,3
whats that supposed to mean,3
you know no offense or anything kate but i think im starting to see larrys side of the story,3
im hungry,3
right so we shouldve been able to cover more of them,3
we wouldve had enough gas to get us there if you hadnt gotten us lost besides a kilometer is less than a mile,3
i told you a liter was less than a gallon,3
the book said they have a lot of rail strikes in italy,3
couldnt we just have taken a train,3
what was i gonna do tell him the truth,3
your brother,3
only its in italian,3
only what,3
a phone message only,3
what is it,3
were saved,3
oh right,3
were not looking to arrest the man faith were trying to locate him,3
maybe theres fingerprints on it,3
a rich possibly fat slob,3
a butterfinger wrapper,3
whatd you find,3
ah ha,3
so maybe his room hasnt been cleaned yet maybe theres something in there that might help us maybe theyll let us go in and take a look around,3
so,3
the guy at the desk said he only left about a half hour ago right,3
i just got a dial tone,3
i dont think he understood what you were saying whats the airport number,3
did i or did i not offer to have it cleaned,3
you cant really blame him for being upset it was an armani suit,3
he fell out,3
what are you doing,3
faith ive seen it already okay if i spot somebody whos got a head thats an eighth of an inch around standing underneath a tuba ill recognize him from the photo otherwise im telling you its not gonna do me any good,3
just once more so youll be sure to know what to look for,3
you and the other 99 of the women in the world,3
ill never meet the man of my dreams,3
we lost him,3
you gave it your best shot you tried,3
i cant believe we came all this way and hes gone,3
well were here and more importantly hes here well cut back on everything else,3
yes cathy lee crosby stayed here,3
are you sure,3
of the rich and famous of which we are neither are you out of your mind we cant afford this,3
what,3
this is a lifestyles hotel,3
i dont know maybe think of it as an adventure,3
gritty is this gonna be one of those youth hostel dives jammed with backpackers who dont believe in deodorant,3
its called the gritty palace,3
the book said they have boats that are like taxis vaporettos whats the name of the place were staying again,3
now what do we do,3
sure im fine i dont know why i never did this before i mean whats the big deal,3
you okay,3
youre coming with me,3
i keep it in the glove compartment in case of emergencies,3
maybe,3
live happily ever after,3
how hard can it be ill land there ill go to his hotel ill introduce myself and,3
a foreign land full of millions of italian men speaking italian with italian accents and those huge brown eyes and that silky olive skin,3
he was on his way to venice right i called the tourist bureau and i mustve called every hotel in the city but i found where hes staying,3
youre just going to fly to italy and start combing the streets,3
thank you so much,3
my god you have,3
no i havent and you forgot about the fortune teller,3
look i know you think this is irresponsible of me but think how much more irresponsible it would be to marry the wrong person,3
i cant believe we did this do i have to remind you that your wedding is in six days,3
of course not i told him i was going to visit a great aunt and dont tell larry either,3
does dwayne know about this,3
would you stop saying that i need you to do me a really big favor,3
because you were afraid to fly,3
thats where youre wrong i got one nine years ago i just never had an opportunity to use it,3
you dont have a passport,3
i have vacation time coming to me,3
what about your job,3
its still the new year,3
but its july,3
it was my new years resolution to overcome it,3
the woman at my dry cleaners believes theres no such thing as coincidence,3
its a coincidence,3
its a miracle,3
after all he is my brother and i know he can be kind of a jerk sometimes but i know him pretty well and i really dont think,3
no i can just tell,3
have you seen him with someone,3
i think hes having an affair,3
is that bad,3
larry brought me flowers last night,3
kate is something the matter,3
i mean just how long are you going to cling to this childish illusion that its all supposed to be perfect well guess what it isnt not for you not for anybody,3
i understand kate what do you think of this garter,3
people have problems insecurities flaws and you have to learn to compromise to overlook to forgive its not settling faith its life real life,3
i know youre right,3
let me tell you something about love there are no prince charmings there are no glass slippers love is hard work,3
yeah i guess youre right i really like the wallpaper we picked out for the den,3
but one day you wake up and realize youve been had of course life isnt like the movies thats why there are movies,3
thats the problem when youre a kid you think life is gonna be like the movies dreams come true the good guys win people live happily ever after all that crap turn,3
oh i dont know i guess its just not quite the way i always thought it was going to be you know like in the movies,3
but what,3
i know it was,3
i think it was sweet of him to pick it out,3
look how big it makes me look i look like an alp,3
come on its not so bad,3
well i wouldntve if i hadnt thought i was in love,3
yes you did,3
he begged me to marry him i didnt even want to marry him,3
if youve never been out with him how do you know you dont want to go out with him,3
why should i ask someone out who i dont want to go out with in the first place,3
why dont you ask him,3
no hes never asked me,3
thrills thats what youre waiting for you know how long that lasts besides how do you know have you ever been out with him,3
hes a podiatrist or something,3
you dont have any idea,3
i dont know kate,3
whats he do,3
so hes not my type let me walk you to the elevator,3
so,3
i dont know i dont think so,3
is he gay,3
no,3
is he married,3
no,3
yeah well larry and his friends are hungry and i did say id try to pick something up,3
i wish you didnt have to go so early,3
no faith they came out of somebodys imagination,3
just that they came out of somebodys experience is all,3
so whats your point,3
but somebody wrote those songs,3
yes you know all the shrinks on donahue say that all those love songs about some enchanted evening are just a cruel hoax that feeds peoples fantasies,3
is everything okay,3
i think if youre honest with yourself youll admit youve had a chance at a number of amana appliances in your lifetime,3
metaphorically i still dont have an amana freezer,3
its a metaphor its women who always think theres some unknown out there thats going to be better than whats in front of them and instead wind up with nothing,3
i dont have an amana freezer,3
dont tell me oprah did a show,3
so you gotta be a little flexible look at your brother and me larrys not perfect neither am i but we work it out were not unrealistic in our expectations and we have each other i think youve got the door number three syndrome,3
oh,3
scientologist,3
how about that guy at the bank,3
just moved in with his girlfriend,3
how about the other one his friend,3
no he smokes,3
what about that guy you work with mike whatshisname,3
youre an accountant for cryin out loud,3
i dont believe in statistics,3
yeah hes around somewhere,3
i dont know i guess i never really thought about it is larry here,3
thats exactly what you are,3
huh,3
giovanni,3
you think im just one of those italian casanovas the guys who try to seduce every woman who comes their way who prey on unhappily married women who lure unsuspecting,3
but i do want to,3
you dont have to go if you dont want to,3
no you dont understand its been wonderful meeting you but i have a husband i have two kids at camp i have a life i have to go back to,3
i thank you,3
giovanni i want to thank you,3
what do the years matter ive known you for centuries,3
how old are you,3
you see in america they care for work they live to work but in italy they care for food for love for pleasure,3
oh,3
its siesta,3
id love to,3
oh hello i just came by to see if you wanted to join me for a drink but,3
giovanni this is faiths friend peter,3
oh,3
a pig a pig shes saying hes a pig,3
a porco,3
shes saying hes a a porco,3
my friend is looking for her brother and she thinks this woman knows where he is can you tell us what shes saying,3
this is your most lucky day my family runs a pension not three blocks from here,3
no well i dont know well maybe later,3
you are looking for a place to stay no kate,3
kate,3
and you are,3
she didnt give me a chance,3
and you didnt tell her,3
she said she knew where to find him and then she grabbed my car keys and,3
she what,3
faith larry has something he wants to tell you about damon bradley,3
yeah,3
he missed me,3
i came after the woman i love,3
i cant tell her shes called off her wedding shell never speak to me again,3
larry youve got to tell her,3
it was a harmless little prank who in the world wouldve thought shed spend her life waiting for this guy,3
i thought shed get a kick out of it,3
went to high school with him but,3
he existed he was some kid i knew from little league he was a real jerk you say hes a friend of dwaynes,3
are you saying you just made the whole thing up the guy never even existed,3
it was just a joke i was pushing the arrow i wanted to get to the next question i wanted to find out who was gonna win the series,3
what you know him,3
damon bradley thats why youre here,3
you said it differently then,3
you used to love it when i called you doll,3
dont call me doll larry i hate it when you call me doll,3
were all desperate for the money doll thats what made this country great back me up on this candy am i right,3
sociologist and because pawn shops are just like prostitutes farm auctions and coal miners theyre all for sale but none of em would be if they werent desperate for the money,3
its not exploitation these people wanna sell and i wanna buy how are golf clubs exploitation she takes one night class and suddenly shes a socialist,3
not only is it tacky its exploitation,3
no,3
and we didnt have to bring another present,3
right,3
this is the last one before the wedding right,3
well theres nothing here to eat,3
no why,3
uh yeah sure honey did you forget the guys are coming over tonight,3
you miss me,3
kate youre still there i thought youd be on your way home by now,3
sorry,3
thanks,3
oh its you its only peter,3
arent you gonna go introduce yourself,3
thats the guy youve been waiting for all these years,3
ten billion to one,3
i mean realistically what are the odds that this is a terrific guy,3
thats really romantic,3
and if thats not destiny i dont know what is,3
whatever and i thought please god give me a sign give me some way to keep this woman from getting into that taxi and disappearing from my life forever and he did she told me the name granted it wasnt my name but it was a start,3
mania,3
and then i saw her and all i know is when i looked in her eyes i saw something light and life and passion and yearning and something else i cant even put my finger on something id never seen before,3
do you know i wasnt even supposed to be in rome my boss was supposed to come to this conference and at the last minute he got the measles the measles who gets the measles at fortythree so they sent me and i wasnt supposed to be in that piazza that night either id gone to the movies only it was sold out so i was wandering around just wandering when i got hit in the head with this shoe,3
good strategy,3
it was an emergency i only lied that night because it was the only way i knew to stop her i knew if i didnt id never see her again,3
no thats not fair thats not it at all look something somewhere got screwed up maybe some metaphysical wires got crossed i may not have the right name but i was there im the guy im skywriting,3
she went out to check into skywriting i cant believe you lied is this a genetic thing men will say anything just to get laid,3
where is she,3
shes not here,3
i have to talk to her,3
you know johnny when he gets mad,3
ill come over when im ready,3
id get over there terry ill take the little lady home,3

talk louder i cant hear you,3
and dont be walking off with any of that you know how the boss feels about individual pilferage,3
thats all next witness,3
what do you mean odd we was robbed like i told you,3
doesnt it seem odd to you that five different waterfront locals were broken into last night and the only articles removed were financial records,3
we was robbed last night and we cant find no books,3
well where are they,3
sure we keep records,3
you mean to sit there and tell me that your local takes in sixtyfive thousand five hundred dollars every year and keeps no financial records,3
this is for you to figure out you can have it your way or you can have it his way but you cant have it both ways am i right sonny,3
but my own kid bro?€?,3
then dont,3
johnny i cant do that i cant do that johnny,3

my old boyfriend tommy would never have gotten me in a mess like this at least ihesi got brains,3
all right put it on heavy,3
i still dont know what ever made me go steady with a crackpot writer like you,3
i dont know yet well just have to watch our chance when it comes ill know what to doi hope ill know what to do,3
what can we do against them,3
ive got the ropes loose now ive got my hands free be carefuldont change your expression too much they must not catch on,3
and i thought you loved me,3
yes that sudden if it werent for you we wouldnt be hunting for an old cemetery on a night like this its all your fault,3
that sudden,3
i should hope not i hate you,3
they wouldnt dare put us in the same grave bor would theyb,3
oh no im not these heathens probably have an open grave for us,3
youre talking nonsense,3
yes i feel it in my bones,3
you do,3
be careful oh please be careful well never get out of here alive i know it i just feel it,3
hold on just a little longer shirley,3
im frightened im so frightened,3
my guess is if we dont take the chance pretty soon were not going to have much life left anyway,3
nothing is worth your life,3
i amits our only chance,3
be careful,3
the ropes are coming loose,3
whatever you do dont do that,3
im afraid ill faint,3
easy shirley easy panic wont do us any good let me think weve got to stall for time,3
i dont know i just dont know but dont give up were not finished yet,3
what can we do,3
dont let them hear you,3
those creatures,3
youve got a right to be were trapped by a bunch of fiends,3
im so frightened,3
be carefultheyll see you,3
look,3
im not sure myself its just a feeling ive had since the crashlike i feel a cold chill all over now this,3
what do you mean,3
im not sure,3
cant we get out of here,3
its an initiation all right but not of a college as you and i know them nothing alive looks like that,3
could it be some kind of college initiation,3
well its probably just the caretaker and thats exactly who we want to find theyll have a telephone cmon,3
i cant imagine anything dead playing that music,3
not dead in a cemetery,3
what help will that do if something in there isnt dead,3
all right dont worry ill be right beside you,3
im not sure i care to find out what it is,3
somethings making that music,3
what help can we possibly find in the cemetery at this time of night,3
thats what i want to find out we have to get help,3
thenthen whats that music,3
silly theres nothing in there to be afraid of,3
it frightens me,3
in there,3
where,3
well we certainly cant stay here cmon,3
okay,3
im getting the jitters lets turn back,3
theres an old cemetery on this road ive been there before,3
well fact or not i dont see how were going to find an ancient cemetery in these mountains tonight i cant see a thing lets turn back,3
all of my books are based on fact or legend thats perhaps why theyre more interesting and sell in the top spots,3
whos to say my monsters arent alive,3
thats life my kisses are alive,3
your puritan upbringing holds you back from my monsters but it certainly doesnt hurt your art of kissing,3
shirley i wrote for years without selling a single word,3
but horror stories why all the time horror stories,3
sure there areand ive tried them all plays love stories westerns dog stories huh now there was a good one that dog story all about,3
but therere so many wonderful things to write about bob,3
you wouldnt understand seeing a cemetery on a night like this can stir in the mind the best ideas for a good horror story,3
but does it have to be in a cemetery,3
no its on a night like this when the best ideas come to mind,3
we sure picked the wrong night to find a cemetery lets turn back,3
now hurry hurry i will watch your desires may be my pleasure alsoour fitting climax to an evenings enter tainment you musthurry now,3
thank you master thank you,3
you better hope there is,3
is there time,3
you may take her now,3
you mean,3
your pleasures of course,3
for what,3
the timeis short,3
all others were but infinitessimal bits of fluff compared to iheri this one would have idiedi for feathers furs and fluffand so she did,3
hahh there is always time all in good timethere is balwaysb time you shall have your pleasure bthatb i idecreei,3
oh if there is only time,3
there is yet time dont you want your own pleasure,3
the bmoonb is almost bgoneb,3
then cancel my order,3
you had the mummy cancel all the others scheduled for this session,3
i will decide the conclusion,3
the moon sinks lower into the hills we must hurry to the finish,3
well then let us proceed,3
there are others,3
then see that it does not happen again in the penalty of everlasting despair now are there others,3
i understand master,3
your own pleasure comes only after mine when i desire it i am the sole ruler of the dark world there is no one to challenge my authority here my word is the lawall powerful bno oneb is to challenge that authority bno oneb is that understood it is my command,3
i would have time for my own pleasures,3
i know the laws of the night i state there is still time for yet another,3
at the first sight of the mornings rays light,3
ahh there is yet time,3
the moon is almost gone,3
at your discretionbut first i desire more entertainment,3
when,3
ahh she will be yours,3
well,3
the princess of darkness would have you for her own to join us through extreme pain yet i am inclined for one as lovely as you to be more lenient i have but to touch you with my finger and it would mean the end of you all over quickly and painlessly,3
she is to be bmineb it is so spoken,3
ahh but i declare there is still time for isomeithing,3
it would seem so master,3
i suppose most of the others will have to wait for their judgement until after the next full moon,3
at the first sight of the morning suns rays we must be gone,3
yes yes yes i know all that,3
as you wish master,3
now i will talkto the wolf manand the mummy,3
she pleases me permit her to live in the world of the snakes,3
it would seem so master,3
oh yes a religion of sorts,3
as i said a worshipper of snakes and of smoke and flames,3
she was,3
her dance has pleased me,3
el dia de los muertosa celebration in her country,3
she came to us on the day of the dead,3
she loved the bull ring and the matador she danced to their destruction now she dances to her own destruction her dance is of skulls,3
what kind of symbol,3
a symbol master,3
and what is this,3
tie them that they may watch,3
a situation easily remedied,3
but they are not yet one of us,3
yes sir master,3
ahh good then i will see them dismiss the rest,3
there are one or two which should complement the nights entertainment master,3
you are the keepers of the damned you two know them all and i am tired of this usual type of entertainment i wanta decided change,3
then it is some service you desire of us,3
aaaahhhh,3
well rest easy im not angry with either of you,3
its not often an emperor like iyoui calls on creatures like us,3
then why do you shake so,3
we dont know of anything master,3
you know better than that,3
have we in some way made you angry master,3
yes master and we caught them him and me,3
live ones where only the dead should be,3
yes master,3
they are live ones,3
i repulse you very well it seems you have chosen your own fate live with it i should say bdieb with it,3
no no no,3
you need not worrynot just now anyway,3
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa,3
i have promised both the wolf man and the mummy a reward it could be that byoub are that reward,3
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa,3
im so frightened,3
ahh the curiousity of youth on the road to ruin may it ever be so adventurous,3
without the snake of course,3

outside of that,3
whats he do now tell fortunes,3
is that snoopy in the purple doo rag,3
or two,3
i think glenn opened his big mouth and now we got us another partner,3
whatta you think,3
love is funny,3
fight over tuna casserole may have spurred slaying seems this womans livein boyfriend seventy years old complained about her tuna noodle casserole and she shot him in the face with a twelvegauge police found noodles in the womans hair and think the guy dumped the casserole dish on her before she shot him theyd been together ten years,3
she just sat there looking right at me,3
they know where i live i guess they know what i drive so maybe we should pick up another car on the way,3
he isnt fighting no more glenn told me the snoops been managing some guys up there now works out at the kronk,3
snoopy christ i thought hed be brain dead by now,3
remember snoopy miller his old pal from lompoc,3
well first off if you were glenn you wouldnt be thinking,3
i been thinkin if i was glenn i was up there to take down the ripper where would i go,3
first thing we do we get to detroit we find glenn then we find a window to throw him out of,3
now youre talkin,3
lets go to detroit,3

i guess adeles in good hands,3
uhhuh,3
there you see the guy sitting on the porch the old ladies and one guy you know theyll have a couple more in a car somewhere,3
in here with my suntan lotion and beach towel thats her place,3
you at least bring the gun,3
im a tourist,3
nice disguise,3

chinos gonna wanna talk to me,3
you better come see this,3
what,3
well leave first thing in the morning,3
longer we hang around down here jack better chance there is either glenns gonna fuck up the whole score or we gonna get busted or both,3
am i going to detroit by myself,3
think this old guy is her boyfriend its the only picture she carries,3
youll have to ask glenn and most likely hes on his way to detroit where we should be,3
yeah but what happened after she drove off with glenn,3
just that she got away,3
say anything in there about karen sisco,3
paper says theres ten grand each on you chino and lulu,3

they pass this picture around you can go anywhere you want nobodyll know you,3
sounds great,3
theres a store around the corner ill be right back,3

cause she had her hand on her gun the whole time waiting to make her move,3

i want to talk to her again thats all see what would happen under you know normal circumstances,3
you want to take her to my place and get cleaned up you come out of the bathroom with your aftershave on and she goes oh i had you all wrong,3
he aint the problem jack,3
i dont know why but every time he opens his mouth i want to punch him out,3
his idea gimme a break fuckin guys got a vacant lot for a head was you and me figured the whole thing out,3
how bout the score was his idea to begin with,3
why you brought glenn into this ill never know,3
i brought em theyre back at glades in the cadillac you wanted to take her car,3
wait a minute let me have your raincoat somebody forgot to bring me clean clothes,3

im just going to the bathroom,3
you coming back,3
dont talk like that okay you scare me,3
no youre right or buddy i wont ask if hes with you or what youre doing here in detroit or if youve run into glenn michaels yet,3
i dont think we should get into that,3
so she did help you,3
to warn her about chino,3
you were going to see her,3
outside adeles,3
where,3
you know i saw you on the street,3
really i was thinking the same thing if we could call time and get together for a while,3
i couldnt believe it i was thinking of you by then a lot wondering what it would be like if we did meet like if we could take a timeout,3
i wasnt sure you caught that,3
you waved to me in the elevator,3
i dont know i hadnt worked that part out yet all i knew was that i liked you and i didnt want to leave you there never see you again,3
what were you gonna do with me,3
why not,3
you believe that,3
i hear he didnt mean to the cop fell as dillinger was aiming at his leg and got him through the heart,3
he killed a police officer,3
i mightve smelled like a sewer but you could tell i was a gentleman they say john dillinger was a pretty nice guy,3
yeah but in a nice way,3
you kept touching me feeling my thigh,3
she did huh,3
remember how talkative you were in the trunk adele said you do that when youre nervous,3
thats not what you were about to say,3
you really wear that suit,3
so do you,3
you like taking risks,3
it would be worth the risk,3
if i remembered you i came looking for you i wouldve said sure lets do it but for all you knew i could show up with a swat team why would you trust me,3
well id say who i was and do you remember me and ask if youd like to meet for a drink,3
if i had answered what were you gonna say,3
i called your room from downstairs,3
oh god,3
or once,3
it doesnt have to its something that happens its like seeing a person you never saw before you could be passing on the street you look at each other and for a few seconds theres a kind of recognition like you both know something but then the next moment the persons gone and its too late to do anything about it but you remember it because it was right there and you let it go and you think what if i had stopped and said something it might happen only a few times in your life,3
well does it make sense to you,3
its not a game something you play,3
its your game ive never played this before,3
i dont think it works if were somebody else you know what i mean gary and celeste jesus what do they know about anything,3
not yet dont say anything yet okay,3
how far do we go with this,3
no what do you do for a living gary,3
having it cleaned didnt help huh,3
it smelled,3
you did,3
i had one just like it well it was the same idea but i had to get rid of it,3
i like your hair and that suit,3
i dont have a problem with it,3
a girl,3
what as a sales rep,3
is that how you think of yourself,3
im a sales rep i came here to call on a customer and they gave me a hard time because im a girl,3
well we got that out of the way tell me celeste what do you do for a living,3
love it,3
you like bourbon,3
no theyre all right i meant you just got here,3
those guys bother you,3
dont leave me,3
i can go to the bar,3
it takes hours to get a drink around here theres only one waitress,3
i just thought maybe you and me could,3
whatta you mean uwellu make it an island,3
im partial to mountains myself but if you like islands well make it an island,3
one last score that the idea move to some island,3
hes dead he did twentyseven years before he came out and died not too long after in charity hospital i think trying to make up for all the good times hed missed thats not gonna be me,3
unless you wanna tell me,3
why you think he might tell you where i am,3
something ive been wondering what ever happened to your uncle cully,3
i can just picture that a cute girl like you following slipandfall and whiplash cheaters,3
my dads retired he was a private investigator forty years i used to work for him,3
because youre having too much fun,3
why not,3
you wont do that,3
theres a guy here on the task force right now maybe i should put him on the phone let you two work it out,3
sure ill just leave em with the swat guy answers the door,3
lets see you could come on by my dads place drop em off,3
how do we do that,3
think i could have them back,3
and your gun,3
how do you know wait you have my wallet,3
really he has a cops face,3
thats my dad,3
im just worried maybe im not old enough for you,3
none of your business,3
who was it answered the phone,3
howd you get this number,3
yes,3
you know who this is,3
shit,3
get your hands up and turn around unowu,3
uhhuh well but if,3
i mean romantically,3
really,3
i never thought it made sense though the way they got together so quick,3
yeah,3
with robert redford when he was young,3
another one faye dunaway was in i liked ithree days of the condori,3
you have to be kidding,3
im just saying i think if we met under different circumstances,3
youd probably tell me,3
i mean if you didnt know who i was,3
nothing,3
youre sure easy to talk to i wonder say we met under different circumstances and got to talking say you were in a bar and i came up to you i wonder what would happen,3
it wasnt pretty after no but if you were in that car eating a sandwich you wouldnt have known what hit you,3
bleeding on a country road,3
yeah right anyway that scene where warren beatty and faye dunaway get shot i remember thinking at the time it wouldnt be a bad way to go if you have to,3
peter finch,3
and the guy saying he wasnt gonna take any more shit from anybody,3
inetworki yeah she was good,3
yeah i liked her in that movie about tv,3
faye dunaway,3
that part in the movie where they get shot warren beatty and i cant think of her name,3
it was may 1934 near gibsland louisiana,3
youre full of interesting facts arent you,3
they put a hundred and eightyseven bullet holes in clyde bonnie parker and the car they were driving bonnie was eating a sandwich,3
is that right,3
i dont recall his hat but ive seen pictures of him lying dead shot by texas rangers did you know he didnt have his shoes on,3
oh you mean of bonnie and clyde hm you ever see pictures of him the way he wore his hat you could tell he had that dontgiveashit air about him,3
you must see yourself as some kind of clyde barrow,3
yeah well if it turns out i get shot like a dog itll be in the street not off a goddamn fence,3
you know this isnt gonna end well these things never do,3
sure,3
we still talk though,3
uhhuh,3
it was just a year give or take a few days i mean its not like we didnt get along or anything we had fun we just didnt have that that thing you know that spark you know what i mean you gotta have that,3
you were married all those falls im surprised you had time,3
jesus you sound like my exwife,3
what do you want me to do scream i dont think it would help much im just gonna sit back take it easy and wait for you to screw up,3
you dont act like it,3
of course i am,3
you dont seem all that scared,3
i dont have to i dont rob banks,3
basically yeah if i go back now i do a full thirty years no time off can you imagine looking at that,3
i know the difference you were in lompoc usp the federal penitentiary ive delivered people there so basically youve spent half your life in prison,3
i believe you would have another fall i did seven years at lompoc and i dont mean the place next door where some of nixons people went,3
it was me i woulda left ol gus on the floor,3
i thought so too,3
thats funny,3
tell you the truth i dont know i started when i was eighteen driving for my uncle cully and his partner gus they go into a bank this one time in slidell gus jumps the counter to get the tellers and breaks his leg all three of us ended up in angola,3
how many was that,3
time i was convicted in california fbi told me id robbed more banks than anyone in the computer,3
why are you famous,3
jack foley youve probably heard of me,3
so whats uyouru name itll be in the paper tomorrow anyway,3
buddy thats his given name,3
who buddy yeah hes a good guy back when we jailed together hed call his sister every week without fail shes a bornagain christian does bookkeeping for a televangelist buddy calls her up confesses his sins tells her about whatever bank he happened to rob,3
must be quite a pal risk his own ass like this,2
if they get set up in time which i doubt and even if they do theyll be looking for a buncha little latin fellas not a big black guy driving a ford,3
you wouldnt have time anyway we come to a roadblock theyll run the car find out in five seconds who it belongs to,3
guys like me huh well listen even though ive been celibate lately im not gonna force myself on you ive never done that in my life,3
the idea of going after guys like you appealed to me,3
yeah went real nice with that twelve gauge too tell me why in the world would someone like you ever become a federal marshall,3
i believe it youve ruined a nine hundreddollar suit my dad gave me,3
boy it stunk in there,3
in my bag in the car,3
wheres your gun your pistol,3
you devil its mace huh whatve you got here a billy use it on poor unfortunate offenders,3

the fish,3

its possible why,3
you gonna go get him,3
none id like to share,3
he doesnt seem to hold a grudge what iii want to know is why they got such a big score up north did foley hang around miami for so long any thoughts on that one,3
so what i want to know is why buddy still calls his sister every week even after she turned him in,3
so,3
buddys sister regina mary bragg got two calls from buddy up in detroit this morning called burdon shes also the one gave burdon buddys address,3
i imagine you wouldve though,3
i didnt have time,3
you wave back,3
i couldnt swear to it but im pretty sure he did,3
he waved to you,3
yeah but you talked all the way from gci to the turnpike it sounds more like a first date than a kidnapping,3
foley ikidinapped me,3
you like the wild ones dont you tillman nicolet and now foley you know ive always said theres a thin line between the cowboy cops and the armed robbers all those guys that love to pack,3
my married boyfriend setting him up with that news story so you could talk about infidelity i couldnt believe it,3
maybe but youre also curious about the man twice last night you asked your married boyfriend nicolet about him you were concerned but you didnt want to show it,3
i want to bust his ass put him in shackles,3
but you know hes dirty and you still wanna see him again,3
not at all,3
he remind you of that guy tillman,3
hes pretty laid back confident,3
remember pay attention to how she talks about foley her tone do it right shell tell you things she wouldnt tell burdon tell her you think hes a nice guy no first tell her about being in the trunk with him in the dark for half an hour and see how she takes it if shes in on it what does she get for all the aggravation cops breathing on her i bet nothing so she still likes him enough to stick her neck out you think thats possible what kind of guy is he,3

we got a saying here alowha,3
yeah,3
whos gonna to that japan is four thousand miles away so you guys just arrived huh,3
what about easier to hit in an air raid,3
the brass is afraid of sabotage this makes em easier to protect and easier to service,3
hey what is this the planes all bunched up like that,3
hang on,3
so beautiful,3
from the air,3
wellsure,3
hey have you seen pearl harbor at night,3
he told me he didnt want to leave me with regret now thats all i have,3
sorry,3
i swore not to talk about him tonight but theres all this stuff i think i ought to tell you that he didnt get a chance to rafe washe was lonely he had such high expectations of himself that he always felt empty the week he met you he told me he felt his heart had always lived in winter and for the first time in his life he has seen the spring,3
i was just thinking that war is a series of goodbyes do you think thats why were meeting to help us say goodbye to rafe,3
that might not have been such a good idea theyre making us fly out of a halfpaved airfield the real punishment is that i wont be back to the barracks till its too late for dinner or coffee so i guess its goodbye for awhile,3
we got some soldiers in traction from a jeep accident but its quiet except for the occasional fighter plane buzzing us,3
hows everything,3
he said that,3
he said youre the only one he ever saw who was better in the air than him,3
i taught him to drink beer he taught me how to fly,3
you were more like brothers,3
rafes folks had a crop dusting business owned their own planes real straight frugal my father was the town drunk went to sleep one night on the railroad tracks and was still there when the dawn express came along rafe and i were the only ones at the funeral he took me back to his house and i never left,3
he told me about you that he had no other friend like you,3
before rafe left he asked me to be the one to tell you if it happened,3
were isnt that what you mean were because hes dead isnt he and thats why youve come,3
lieutenant im danny walker im rafe mccawleys best friend,3
yyes sir,3
no baseball diamonds red,3
colonel to ffight you need strategy to have strategy ya gotta practice and to practice it ya gotta play,3
id like to bomb their emperor too but i think thatd just piss em off the idea here gentlemen is not revenge were here to prove to them that theyre neither invincible nor superior so lets try this again military targets only,3
i ddont think japs oughta be allowed to pplay baseball,3
now we have fifteen requests for the emperors palaceand one for tokyo baseball stadium,3
i have a phrase i want you all to memorize lushu hoo megwa fugi it means i am an american in chinese,3
then whwhere do we land,3
we wont have the fuel to get back to the carriers theyll turn and run back to hawaii the minute were airborne,3
ccolonel we been ppracticing takeoffs but i aint sure we can land on these carriers ddecks,3
the navy will get us to within 400 miles of the japanese coast well launch off the carriers from there,3
and wheres the secret base sir the one we ttakeoff from,3
i know,3
colonelwere all going whether you make it or not,3
listen you guys im the first plane then mccawley walker the rest of you ill have the shortest run if i dont make it you dont go,3
i take it back about the flowers were all gonna die,3
i thought id made it clear im not just putting this mission together im leading it myself,3
i want to introduce a couple of people doc white is a flight surgeon he has volunteered for gunnery training so that he can go on the mission because we cant spare the weight of an extra man,3
bombers,3
in flight school you qualified in single and in multiengine planes youll be flying multiengines here,3
top secret means you help me pick the other pilots train and go without knowing where youre going until its too late,3
well sure colonel,3
youre just about the only pilots in the army with actual combat experience so youre volunteering for a mission ive been ordered to put together do you know what top secret is,3
is that the good new sir or,3
explain what,3
we can explain colonel,3
i heard what you did,3
thank you sir,3
good luck over there mccawley i admire your decision,3
thank you sir,3
thats bullshit son but its really good bullshit,3
never sir i just meant its dangerous only for the kind of pilot who wants to show off rather than inspire the other pilots in his unit and all youve done for me sir working out the transfer i did it to say thanks to honor you sir what the french call a homage,3
dont get smart with me son,3
how could it be irresponsible sir if you were the first man in the world to do it,3
there are some people who think the outside loop is reckless and irresponsible,3
you too mam,3

were all going away,3
theres one thing i have to say im going away,3

the only reason its hard to say is that i keep thinking i dont have the right to say it but ive got to because its true i love you that must surprise you,3
whatever youre trying to tell me isnt good is it or it wouldnt be so hard to say,3
i was hoping to meet him,3

dannys not coming,3
nice to meet you betty,3
oh this is betty,3
you too lieutenant,3
hello lieutenant good to see you,3
and if we fail and lose our carriers we destroy our ability to fight them at all as soon as the second wave returns we will withdraw,3
if we launch the third wave and annihilate their fuel depots we destroy their ability to operate in the pacific for at least a year,3
the second wave has not returned and we have no idea where their carriers are what is the damage report,3
we have achieved complete surprise the first wave is returning the second is attacking now and we have lost only a few planes we can launch a third wave admiral,3
we must go ahead this is our moment,3
we have a fighter screen up in case we are attacked admiral,3
we have achieved surprise but their carriers are not in port i dont like this,3
a brilliant man would find a way not to fight a war,3
brilliant admiral,3
set up teams of radio operators to send out messages the americans will intercept concerning every potential american target in the pacific include hawaii the clutter will be more confusing that way,3
if we achieve surprise they will offer little resistance,3
everything real except the fact that no one is shooting back at us,3
i have arranged a live fire drill with your permission,3
uncharged torpedoes have different balance,3
god help them,3
the chinese are sending out search parties to try to find the crews before the jap patrols do if any of the planes make it,3
so those brave men are flying blind and running out of fuel,3
thereve been some complications sir the chinese didnt receive our request for homing beacons until is was too late to get them set and the planes had to take off so early they may lack fuel to make the mainland anyway,3
have the planes made it to china,3
we have bombed tokyo mr president radio tokyo interrupted its own broadcast to make the announcement,3
weve done studies were confident we would turn them back eventuallyafter theyd gotten as far as chicago,3
what if the japanese did invade,3
crank her,3
i havena been able ta,3
fook ya dooble,3
learn english then,3
fook ya,3
and if you dont give me a plane that can handle combat you better start learning to speak german,3
if yed wanted a bloody cadillac ya shoulda stayed in the bloody states,3
all of em,3
well which of those three ya want fixed,3
the struts are loose the hydraulics are leaking and the electrical systems shorting out in the cockpit,3
leapin jesus,3
the americans themselves have made it possible we will annihilate them in a single attack at pearl harbor,3
you see us as capable of such a blow,3
the council knows i have opposed fighting the americans no matter how great our resolve they have resources beyond ours if we must go to war there is only one way deal them a blow from which it will take them years to recover in that time we can conquer all of the pacific and they will have no choice but to ask for peace,3
you have something to say yamamoto,3
the time has come to strike or to sit and let the americans cut off our oil and our future i know what you whisper to the others yamamoto that the americans are strong yet look at their leader,3
if knowledge of opponents and careful calculation of danger is taken as weakness then i have misunderstood what it means to be japanese,3
so you join us admiral some of us thought your education at an american university would make you too weak to fight the americans,3
its her 18th birthday i want to show her off,3

it means i care about you and what happens to you,3
does this mean you like me again,3

fat chance you know lee wilkins came to hear me last night he told me to forget it you told me to forget it my parents tell me to forget it,3

you know i never could stand your sarcasm,3
then its true dammit i had a miserable time tonight cause of you when the monotones did book of love ?€??€? chapter four you break up wont you give it just one more chance im thinking did we break up cause if we did i dont even know about it i thought we cleared all that up yesterday did that maynard g beatnik give you what you wanted,3

dolores cant you be a little kinder to people you dont even know the boy if you werent so neurotic and insecure maybe youd shut up for a while and show some compassion,3
god peggy youre so unformed youre practically fetal youre just taking pity on him cause he has no friends,3
first of all richard is not a creep he happens to be an exceptional person if any of you gave him half a chance youd find that out,3
carol and i saw you with that creep richard today,3

right now youre just browsing through time choose the things youll be proud of the things that last,3
but im remembering the future,3

im not afraid i know exactly when im going to die,3
i wish she hadnt,3
you know peggy sue your mother said you had a dream that i died,3

fine grandma would you teach me how to make strudel,3
im not going to marry him i just went out with him once i know why dont we go to the movies tonight just us girls itll be fun,3
but i always thought that you would marry charlie carol would marry walter and i would marry arthur wed all live on the same street and take our kids to the park together and have barbecues every sunday itll spoil everything if you and charlie break up that michael doesnt look like the barbecue type,3
cool it kids hes free to see other girls if he wants,3
hes very interesting for all his pretending to be a tough guy hes really got the soul of a poet,3
yeah hes so cool and mysterious,3

absolutely people dogs elephants,3
so you think time travel is possible for people,3
you can till it with whatever you want from illusions to memory from experience to innocence from happiness to the entire universes,3
whats inside,3
well i think time is like a burrito sometimes it just folds over on itself and one part touches the other,3
i	know what a burrito is,3
thats my own theory based on a mexican food called the burrito i had it once when my parents took me to disneyland,3
whats that,3
and then theres richards burrito,3
well in a newtonian framework the possibilities were limited but with the advent of relativity theory the idea of absolute time can no longer be reasonably affirmed,3
sort of,3
are you doing some kind of science project,3
i want to ask you a question do you thinktime travel is possible,3

charles is right behind me,3
in a word bob,3
are we interrupting andy,3
oh youre right beckett you dont have an attitude problem,3
excuse me charles with all due respect this is preposterous it doesnt make any sense it sounds as if were talking about someone else pardon the lack of humility but ive had the distinct impression i was kind of one of the rising stars around here and i feel that wasnt just my imagination and i also think i deserve to know whats really going on here charles,3
really who thinks that sir,3
some people think you have an attitude problem beckett,3
perhaps youre right ive certainly been busy with the kronos complaint a preliminary injunction hearing and the saunders trial all falling at the same time,3
there wont be a next time i guarantee it,3

honesty is always best,3
weve been talking it over andy your future that is we feel that because we respect you so much we have to be honest with you,3
more than your friend family,3
i know that charles,3
of course,3
thanks for coming in,3
no sweat buddy,3
thanks charles,3
bearing in mind that bill wright the chairman of macrosystems is a close personal friend of mine which side of this mess would uyouu desire to be on andy and dont allow my very tight personal relationship with bill to influence your answer in any way,3
it is and it isnt charles macrosystems new software copies all the bestknown elements of kronos spreadsheet program if theyre allowed to sell it kronos will get undersold right out of business for me the legal principle involved is copyright infringement,3
hes upset hes sorry,3
im trying to help your partner youre not a member of his immediate family i could have you removed from the er,3
dr klenstein its not a pleasant procedure but if the ks is causing the diarrhea we ought to know right away,3
this is my partner we keep records of hospital visits nothing personal,3
sounds delightful,3
meanwhile id like to prepare you for a colonoscopy so we can take a look inside,3
were waiting,3
about my blood work,3
mr beckett im sorry,3
you bet well see you later,3
thanks for coming by,3

i better get home lisa and i are having some friends over,3
it was good working with you andrew youre welcome hey shouldnt you put that thing back on,3
excellent work joe i thank you,3
a good start,3
what,3
what do you call a thousand lawyers chained together at the bottom of the ocean,3
thank you,3
yes,3
can you see the lesions on your chest in this mirror,3
if it please the court id like to ask mr beckett to remove his shirt so that the jury can have an uaccurateu idea of what were talking about,3
yes on my torso,3
do you have any lesions on uanyu part of your body at this time that resemble the lesions that were on your face at the time you were fired,3
well many things but i think the thing i love the most is that every once in a while not that often but occasionally you get to be part of justice being done its really quite a thrill when that happens,3
what do you love about it,3
i love the law i know the law i excel at practicing it its the only thing ive ever wanted to do,3
what makes you an excellent lawyer,3
im an excellent lawyer,3
are you a good lawyer,3
you dont bring your personal life into a law firm youre not supposed to uhaveu a personal life really anyway i did plan to tell charles eventually but then this thing happened at the tennis club,3
can you explain uwhyu you didnt,3
no i didnt,3
in the years you worked at wyant wheeler did you ever tell charles wheeler you were gay,3
i still am,3
except you were gay,3
i suppose you could say that,3
a regular allamerican guy,3
you didnt look then the way you look now,3
its possible i was infected with the hiv virus at that time but i wasnt diagnosed until several years later,3
obviously at this time you werent sick,3
possessed of an encyclopedic knowledge of the law a razor sharp litigator a genuine leader gifted at bringing out the very best in others an awesome ability to illuminate the most complex of legal concepts to colleagues courtrooms the person on the street the kind of person who plays three sets of tennis but doesnt sweat but underneath the elegant surface was an adventurous spirit,3
what kind of person is that,3
he was the kind of person i thought i wanted to be,3
what impressed you about him,3
particularly charles,3
youre ready dont worry,3
ill look over the q and a,3
opera,3
want to hear my favorite aria,3
opera,3
thanks do you like opera,3
i know a good probate lawyer,3
ive made provisions in my will for some charities miguel will need a lawyer i know its not your area,3
we proceed representing your estate,3
what happens,3
ive considered that,3
theres a possibility i wont be around for the end of this trial,3
for a healthy baby for lisa to make it through the delivery for the phillies to get into the playoffs,3
what have you prayed for,3
then we establish how wheelers boys recruited you after law school,3
do you pray,3
what,3
charles okay miller,3
beckett,3
uh huh,3
when you refer to wheeler call him charles to show how youd been admitted to the inner circle you were considered one of them,3
lets review these notes for your testimony we have a big day on monday,3
thank you for sharing that with me joe,3
let me tell you something okay when youre brought up like the rest of us in a place like where i was brought up theres not a whole lot of discussion about homosexuals as a kid youre taught right away that queers are weird queers are funny theyre a danger to kids theyre afraid to fight and they all want to cop your joint and that pretty much sums up the general thinking out there if you want to know the truth,3
you survived your first gay party intact,3
youre right,3
correct,3
you think im uncomfortable,3
thank you,3
no we have to do it but later allright,3
sure its fine,3
excuse me im having a goddamn party is that allright with you,3
beer we need to go over your q and a,3
what do you want,3
lets find you a drink,3
get it,3
not bad,3
im a law suit,3
i had a blood transfusion today i feel great,3
beckett you seem better energized more alive,3
its me you dork,3
were friends of becketts,3
parrtyy,3
any settlement agreement umustu include and this is critical a letter of exoneration making clear my termination had nothing to do with the quality of my work,3
one more thing your honor,3
arline,3
arline decision supreme court,3
there is no relevant precedent,3
thank you,3
so kenton connected the lesion uandu whatever suspicions he had about your personal life to this woman maria and blew the whistle on you suddenly youre losing files and its time to let you go but up to this point youve been their golden boy their rising star their behavior is inconsistent,3
no they didnt fire her,3
they didnt fire her,3
the partner who spotted the lesion walter kenton used to work for benton myers in dc theres a paralegal there maria torres shes had lesions on and off for three years she says it was common knowledge around the office that her lesions were caused by aids,3
one of the partners spotted a lesion on my forehead,3
how did they find out,3
rayisha very nice,3
rayisha,3
whats her name,3
huh oh great shes great,3
im a lawyer hows your baby,3
find a lawyer,3
what,3
whod you get,3
fine,3
oh beckett hows it goin,3
dont send flowers joe im not dead yet,3
beckett im sorry about whats happened to you its a fucking kick in the head,3
thanks for your time,3
correct i dont,3
look i know i have a case if you dont want to take it for personal reasons,3
i knew you were going to say that i dont buy it and i dont see a case,3
they sabotaged me,3
okay they want you out its against the law to fire you for having aids so they make you look like a fuck up which leads us to the mysterious lost file,3
joe from the day i arrived to the day they fired me i performed consistently thoroughly and with absolute excellence and if they hadnt fired me thats what id be doing today,3
okay okay they discover you have this horrible disgusting terminal illness and they panic for any number of perfectly valid reasons theyre frightened for themselves their families maybe its the homo angle maybe they dont want to rub elbows with someone whos just popped out of the closet with a terminal case of acne and how do they explain your status to the client for chrissake,3
the law says people with disabilities cannot be terminated so long as they can perform the duties required by their position,3
as in the vegetable,3
i buy that,3
charles i must apologize again for the kronos mishap it was a scary few minutes around here wow but thank god the complaint was found and no damage was done,3
big trouble,3
makeup,3
hell they are staring whats that shit on your face,3
i dove back into work everything was fine until the lesions started,3
continue,3
miguel alvarez weve lived together for nine years,3
your lover,3
my lover and i,3
we,3
i was diagnosed with aids eight months ago during a bout of pneumonia i recovered quickly and was back at work in ten days since i was doing so well on the azt we decided against telling anyone about it,3
continue,3
nine,3
how many lawyers did you go to before you called me,3
i misplaced an important complaint thats their story want to hear mine,3
continue,3
correct im seeking representation,3
you want to sue wyant wheeler hellerman tetlow and brown,3
i was fired by wyant wheeler i plan to bring a wrongful termination suit against charles wheeler and his partners,3
thanks beckett im real excited about it what can i do for you,3
kids are great,3
little baby girl,3
congratulations,3
one week old,3
new baby,3
uh yeah,3
its okay can i sit down,3
whoaoh sorry i,3
i have aids,3
jesus christ what happened to you,3
funny,3
client of yours,3
i know what it means your honor imagine how the children in this neighborhood have been made to feel the pounding of construction ringing in their ears as this skyscraper a tribute to mankinds greed grows daily casting an ominous shadow over their lives filling them with dread even as they are surrounded in a black toxic fog blocking out the sun while poisoning their lungs and counselor calls it harmless,3
defined by websters as harmless,3
innocuous,3
your honor i submit there were no complaints until counselor began knocking on doors drumming up business and the dust which counselor refers to has appeared on only three occasions each time it has been examined and the results,3
your honor since rockwell corp began construction the surrounding residential neighborhood has been enshrouded in a cloud of foulsmelling germcarrying pestilent dust my client is being forced to breathe known carcinogens daily other residents are coming forth on a daily basis to add their voices of outrage,3
get down to word processing help jamey look,3
what can i do,3
fucking word processing lost my kronos complaint which must be filed by fucking five oclock if its late theres no case every problem has a solution,3
i thought i was supposed to be covering for you god andy you look awful,3
catch me later ill be here and tell amy i love her painting its on my wall,3
im late i have to pick up amy from her afterschool but i want to talk to you about that hansen thing,3
rach,3
thank you,3
no i cant really see it,3
answer the question please,3
by the time i was fired there were four lesions on my face much bigger,3
one here in front of my ear,3
do you have any lesions on your face at this time,3
absolutely,3
and its your contention that when the partners were made aware of the lesions they jumped to the conclusion you had aids and fired you,3
thats right,3
youve testified the lesions on your face were visible to the people you worked with correct,3
yes,3
really,3
miguel has not been infected as i said we werent aware of aids then or how it is spread,3
you could have infected him isnt that right,3
yes,3
isnt it true you have spent your life pretending to be something youre not so much so that the art of concealment and dishonesty has become second nature to you,3
in some situations,3
as a homosexual one is often forced to conceal ones sexuality is that right,3
some do i didnt,3
do other lawyers at the firm keep pictures of their spouses or fiances on their desks,3
no,3
did you keep a picture of your lover on your desk,3
that is unotu correct i never lied about it,3
while you were employed at wyant wheeler you did everything you could to make sure no one knew you were an active homosexual correct,3
no,3
do you need a break,3
id heard of usomethingu the gay plague gay cancer but we didnt know how you could get it or that it could kill you,3
youd uheardu of aids in 1984 85,3
that happened once people werent talking about aids then the way we are now or safe sex,2
but you uwereu having anonymous sex in porno theaters in 1984 and 1985,2
its impossible to know exactly when or how i was infected with hiv,3
were you aware in 1984 or 1985 that there was a fatal disease out there called aids and that you could contract it through sexual activity,3
i guess it was 1984 85,3
when approximately what year did this event take place,3
yes,3
do men have sex with each other in that theater,2
yes,3
gay upornographicu movies,3
gay movies,3
what kind of movies do they show there,3
have you ever been to the apollo cinema on sansom street,3
not unnecessary ones,3
in general do you take risks in other areas of your life,3
in my work yes calculated risks you have to,3
do you take risks,3
something like that,3
you said earlier you aspired to be the kind of person who had an adventurous spirit is that correct,3
thanks mom dad,3
all i know is you got through your diagnosis fine like a trooper but when they fired you you were so devastated andy i dont expect any of my kids to sit in the back of the bus fight for your rights,3
mom,3
hes out in his shed showing your uncle his new riding mower,3
wheres dad,3
ancient how do you think i feel put that thing down and give me a hug andrew stop he still doesnt listen,3
hi mom how do you feel on your fortieth anniversary,3
are you on one of those conference calls i hate when you put me on hold,3
gillman says im fine my blood work is excellent tcells are up just a sec yes i think that would alleviate most of our concerns my platelets look good too,3
hold on mom theres no way my client will go along with that,3
whats dr gillman say,3
im fine,3
andy this is a nice surprise how are you hon,3
hi mom its me,3
hello,3
thank you,3
yes im now in charge of the paralegal department,3
were you recently promoted,3
yes,3
miss burton do you still work at wyant wheeler,3
objection,3
he was losing weight he looked kind of tired sometimes but he was working so hard still i felt something was wrong and i cant believe utheyreu saying they didnt notice anything,3
thank you no more questions,3
i said my earrings uareu american theyre africanamerican,3
what did you say,3
apparently mr wheeler felt they were too ethnic is the word she used she said he would like it if i wore something smaller less garish and more american,3
your earrings,3
well one time mr wheelers secretary lydia told me mr wheeler had a problem with my earrings,3
in what way,3
yes,3
no have you ever felt discriminated against at wyant wheeler,3
is that a question,3
ms burton youre black,3
your honor if mr beckett was forced by his illness to use a wheelchair would the defense ask him to park it outside were talking about aids were talking about lesions lets useeu what were talking about,3
we object your honor it would unfairly influence the jury,3
ill withdraw it mr beckett were you living with miguel alvarez in 1984 or 1985 when you had your anonymous sexual encounter in the porn theater,3
objection,3
ill withdraw you were aware when you worked with maria torres that she had aids correct,3
objection,3
ill rephrase did you have anything to do with this file being misplaced,3
objection,3
fact andrew beckett performed at a consistently mediocre level fact he made a grievous error on a multimillion dollar lawsuit fact he claims he is the victim of lies and deceit fact andrew beckett lied to his employers going to great efforts to conceal his disease from them fact he was successful in his duplicity the partners at wyant wheeler did unotu know andrew beckett had aids when they fired him,3
and when lawyers break the law when this society loses respect for the law when that day comes our cherished institutions will be burned to the ground and our children and grandchildren will live like savages,3
or unprotected sex with someone you didnt know very well any time during the last twelve years,2
uh no not really,3
unprotected sex with a prostitute,2
get real,3
a homosexual encounter,3
thanks doc but i dont need an aids test are you crazy but thanks for the information really,3
not by touching or shaking hands or hugging using the same toilet even kissing someone with aids is safe but it theres something in your past youre worried about,3
it doesnt travel through the air by breathing or touching right,3
right,3
the guy sat in my office you cant get aids that way right,3
you want to give me an aids utestu,3
joe i dont care a whit about your private life,3
why are we going to do that,3
were going to draw blood,3
yeah but doc isnt it true they keep finding out new things about this disease so you tell me today theres no danger and i go home and i hold my baby and six months from now i hear on the news whoops we were wrong you ucanu carry it on your clothes your skin and now ive got to worry about my kid what are you doing,3
leave that,3
right,3
the hiv virus can only be transmitted through the exchange of bodily fluids namely blood and semen,3
im not worried what are you doing,3
you had contact with someone who has aids and youre worried,3
since that time ive devoted more thought to the subject and thats how i feel now,3
five months ago you characterized andrew beckett as caviar and now youre calling him a cheeseburger your standards have shifted a great deal and id like to know why youve changed your mind,3
i might,3
its a long way between being overwhelmed and being satisfied a cheeseburger may be satisfying whereas caviar and champagne and roast duck and baked alaska for dessert might be considered overwhelming do you agree,3
it satisfied me,3
did that thrill impress and overwhelm you,3
we won,3
okay mr laird explain this to me like im a four year old did andrew beckett win your lawsuit for you or not,3
i may have said something like that but thats not how i feel at this moment,3
according to the deposition you said you were thrilled impressed overwhelmed by the quality of andrew becketts work do you remember saying that,3
thats correct,3
mr laird when i approached you about being a witness at this trial and you agreed you gave sworn testimony in a deposition is that correct,3
we were satisfied,3
were you pleased with his work,3
thats correct,3
but andrew beckett was in charge of litigation for the suit,3
wyant wheeler represented us,3
andrew beckett represented your company in a lawsuit in 1990 is that correct,3
people who want to bend the rules,3
what kind of people,3
sometimes it seems like society is urunu by these kinds of people,3
yes character to the extent that it affects a persons ability to do a great job,3
explain to me if you can mr wheeler explain this to me like im a ten yearold this trial is not about a disease is that what youre saying unotu about your understandable if unfounded fear of catching aids through casual contact with someone who has it youre saying this trial is about andrew becketts character am i getting this right,3
weve got a committee meeting,3
but hes got lots of other peoples lives to ruin,3
and i hate to rush you out of here but,3
we dont think its fair to keep you here where your future is limited but we wish you luck andy all the luck in the world,3
in a word yes,3
lets put it this way andy your place in the future of this firm is no longer secure,3
youre in trouble,3
andy before we begin id just like to say everyone in this room is your friend,3
get a life,3
youre the asshole buddy,3
fuck you you want to kick my ass you want to try asshole,3
dont you know this is exactly the kind of bullshit that makes people hate you guys,3
take it as a compliment geesh,3

two men making love now tell me again uwhyu is that disgusting,3
yeah,3
joe,3

have you changed your aftershave,3
is there some kind of expression ive picked up from beckett some kind of fairy attitude ive unconsciously adopted am i walking different some kind of vocal thing have i picked up some kind of homo uvibeu,3
dont know joe,3
would you take a client if you were constantly thinking i hope this guy doesnt touch me i dont even want him to ubreatheu on me,3
thats perfectly clear,3
and the way they work out pumping up so they can be macho and faggot at the same time i cant ustandu that shit now im being totally honest with you,3
fine joe,3
i mean two guys doing the horizontal thing i dont get it dont they get confused is that mine i thought it was yours hey call me old fashioned call me conservative i think maybe you have to be a man to get just how nauseating the whole basic idea really is,3

i felt and still feel nothing but the deepest sympathy and compassion for people like maria who have contracted this terrible disease through no fault of their own,3
but didnt you avoid contact with ms torres after you found out she had aids she says you acted repulsed by her and you avoided her is that correct,3
i uknowu the difference that doesnt mean im always able to recognize the difference,3
so you are aware of the difference between a lesion and a bruise is that correct,3
usheu didnt try to conceal it,3
like firing andrew beckett taught uhimu a lesson,3
yes we did,3
you taught him a lesson,3
we stuck his head in the latrine after ten of us had used it,3
how did you do that,3
yeah but we took care of him,3
like two sailors playing hide the salami,3
going on like,3
so during those long voyages months at a time out to sea no women in sight a hundred hardworking robust young men in the prime of their life at the peak of their natural appetites desires their god given hormonal uinstinctsu anything going on,3
not when i was in the navy,3
any women on board,3
anywhere from two weeks to several months,3
a trial takes utimeu beckett do you know what im saying,3
whoa whoa what do you expect them to say youre alan dershowitz,3
beckett,3
your honor may i have ten minutes in redirect,3
this would be a good time to break for the day,3
you had one guy like that,3
lets continue,3
no we dont however as regards this witness im going to sustain the defenses objection,3
with all due respect your honor we dont live in this courtroom do we,3
in this courtroom mr miller justice is blind to matters of race creed color religion and sexual orientation,3
very good joe now belinda ive got a figure over here of one million five i,3
based on what my client would have earned over the next three years including benefits and projected raises and the extraordinary cost of medical care for someone with acquired immune deficiency syndrome we would settle today for the very fair amount of one million five hundred thousand dollars,3
hold it joe he wants to come back to work chuck,3
reinstatement at full salary back pay covering the period of unemployment and,3
by god you uwillu settle it if you force this case to trial young man youll regret it for the rest of your naturalborn days now joseph what would you require to settle this matter today,3
if it please your honor we uhopeu to settle this matter,3
on behalf of the defendants,3
ill take that under consideration your honor,3
ive seen your television commercials if you or anyone you know has been injured through the fault of others it should say through the unegligenceu of others,3
joseph miller your honor macready and shilts legal services,3
attorney for the plaintiff,3
you have to make a decision is this guy partner material,3
to suit their personal desires and the rest of us have to live with it,3
andy you dont want this,3
youll be sorry beckett,3
holy shit did you bob,3
wait a minute the man was fired for incompetence not because he has aids you didnt know he was sick did you bob,3
we ought to be suing him,3
andrew brought aids into our offices into our mens room he brought aids to our annual goddamn family picnic,3
dr j,3
julius,3
helloooo,3
andy it seems that something has come over you lately a kind of stupor a fogginess a lack of focus earth to andy anybody home,3
kings are out of fashion id rather be thought of as a benevolent tyrant its an antitrust action,3
its good to be king hey charles,3
its time to get this society back on track,3
but we shouldnt have fired him,3
but now were standing up for ourselves,3
i didnt tell the others i was afraid to,3
if you feel differently bob you should say so when youre called to the stand after all this isnt a conspiracy,3
charles,3
very interesting bob lets make a note of that andy didnt lose the complaint in his computer he never put it in he lied about that too,3
no matter how hard i try i cant lose a file in my computer,3
keep them from that area on grounds of relevancy what bob,3
ive discovered something interesting charles,3
bob i must ask you to shut the fuck up did andrew beckett say i might not be able to serve our clients to the ubest of my abilityu he said nothing and now andrew beckett proposes to haul me into a court of law to sling accusations at me in full view of the entire philadelphia judicial establishment my god,3
he was doing a great job,3
bob youre trying my patience andrew beckett is making his private life our business we gave him kronos did he say im sick i might not be able to see this through,3
thats kind of extreme walt andys private life is none of our business,3
lets settle with andy and put this whole tragic mess behind us,3
what deviant groups or organizations did he secretly belong to what is it bob,3
charles,3
what about other homosexual facilities whatever they are,3
jesus,3
interview every employee support staff associates partners did uanyu of them know andy was sick uhowu did they know did he tell them did they notice something was wrong with his appearance none of this information got to the managing partners we know that make sure everyone else does too and beckett i want to know everything about his personal life did he frequent those pathetic bars on camac street,3

well guess if it was trickeration hed just do me huh then againi am worth twice as much alive didnt know johns aint a cop oh hes got that shiny badge an all but nah hes just a merc and im just a payday thats why he wont kill me the creed is greed,3
why whatd you hear,3
you scare me riddick thats what you wanna hear isnt it there i admit it can i get back to work now,3
i asked what uyouu thought,3
entered our minds,3
an now youre worried about a repeat of history,3
i got the quickandugly version,3
strange not doin a runup on the main drive yet strange unless he told you the particulars of my escape,3
theyre coming,3
power cells,3
look deeper,3
then where is he hes not in the hole we looked,3
fairly fuckin ironic wouldnt you say slamlights so dim that you go and get your eyeballs taken out and shined up then you wind up here three asskick suns maybe i did do a few people but not this one no maam not this time,3
heard about it just never seen it,3
slam doctor well we called him doctor,3

show me your eyes,3
all you people are so scared of me an most days id take that as a compliment but it aint me you gotta worry about now,3
the ones tellin me to go for the sweet spot just to the left of the spine fourth lumbar down the abdominal aorta what a gusher had a cup on his belt so i used it to catch a little runoff metallic taste to it human blood coppery but if you cut it with peppermint schnapps that goes away course thats more for winter summertime i take mine straight,3
what whispers,3
mean the whispers,3
tell me about the sounds you told them you heard something right before if you dont talk to me johnsll take another crack at it at your skull,3
i think i twisted my ankle running backwards like that and im not sure i can okay thats a lie i just dont want to be alone back there anymore if you could just give me a few minutes up front here,3
what switch what,3
can we switch,3
lets move just a detour hell get us there,3
well have to carry the cellsdrag themwhatever it takes,3
i hate to kill a beautiful theory with an ugly fact but that sandcat wont run at night,3
awright so maybe well have enough light,3
possibly,3
those umbrellas the ones that mist would they burn if you got a receipt,3
not sure ten,3
how many bottles,3
spirits anything over 45 proof burns well,3
one cutting torchone handlight here two more in the cabini uthinku two more,3

i know whats in here,3
christ you dont know whats out there,3
cargo hold everyone in the cargo hold lesgo lesgo lesgo,3
just a suggestion but perhaps we should flee,3

what do my eyes see,3
200yearold singlemalt scotch is to booze as foie gras is to duck guts,3
this is it booze uthatsu what you have to drink,3

tried to kill us in our sleep paris had it right we uareu disposable were just walking ghosts to her,3
just shut up okay,3
she tried to blow the whole fucking passenger cabin tried to kill us,3
this does not help us johns,3
no no youre right fry whats to be afraid of my life is a steamin pile of meaningless toadshit anyhow so i say mush on canyons only couple hundred meters after that were in skiff city so why dont you just butch up stuff a cork in that kid and get,3

stay in the light everybody stay in the fucking,3
we arent completely stupid,3
riddick uriddicku,3
so you noticed too,3
i dont get it johns what is so goddamn valuable in your life that youre worried about losing huh is there anything at all besides your next hype got no right to be so scared neither one of us,3
you give him the cells and the ship and he will leave you he will leave you all out there to die,3
were just burnin light here,3
hell lead you over the first cliff you know that dont you,3
because youre 79 kilos of gutless white meat and uthatsu why you cant come up with a better plan,3
79 kilos,3
how much,3
what the hells it matter,3
how much you weigh johns,3
hey why dont you rag your hole for two seconds and let someone else come up with a plan that doesnt involve mass suicide,3
for your own fear,3
smoke screen for what,3
oh dont use her like that for a smoke screen,3
look we gotta think about everyone now the kid especially how scared is she gonna be out there,3
we can stick to the plan if we get four cells back to the skiff were off this rock,3
oh lady if youre in your right mind i pray you go insane,3
sokay sokay i killed it,3
stop it stop it stop it,3
you coulda helped and you didnt,3
my first runin with riddick went for the sweetspot and missed they had to leave a piece of the shiv in there i can feel it sometimes pressing against the cord so maybe the care and feeding of my nerveendings is my business,3
anything uelseu we should know about you johns christ here i am lettin you play games with our lives when,3
owens was already dead his brain just hadnt caught on to that fact,3
uyouu made it a problem when you let owens die like that when you had enough drugs to knock out a fucking muleteam,3
not a problem unless youre gonna make,3
and here you got two mornings every day wow were you ubornu lucky,3
you have a little caffeine in the morning i have a little morphine so what,3
never said you were a hype either,3
i never said i was,3
youre not a real cop are you just some mercenary who goes around talkin about the law like,3
i wont give him a chance to grab another ship or to slash another pilots throat,3
dancin on razor blades here,3
hes a murderer the law says hes gotta do his bid,3
you know he hasnt harmed any of us far as i can tell he hasnt even lied to us just stick to the deal johns let him go if thats what it,3
we need a failsafe bring the cells over at the last possible minute when the wings are ready when we uknowu were ready to launch,3
you mean if he learns that youre gonna royally fuck him over,3
mayve noticed chains dont work on this guy only way were truly safe is if he believes hes goin free but if he ustopsu believin,3
oh this is a dangerous game youre playing johns,3
thats what i said,3
you said we were going to trust him now you said there was a deal,3
he also figured out how to kill the pilot fry,3
okay maybe thats a ugoodu thing maybe i can use him to help with,3
hijacked a prison transport made a helluva good run fore i tracked him down,3
he can pilot,3
uget the fucking cells over hereu johns whats the discussion,3
were not sure uwhenu it happens so lets not,3
wait for what until its so dark we cant even find our way back to,3
lets wait on the power cells,3
need those cells from the crash ship shit still gotta check out the hull patch the wings,3
wha,3
60 years ago,3
lets board this up and get the hell gone they seem to stick to the dark so if we stick to daylight should be all,3
so what happened where are they then,3
rag it riddick nobody wants your theories on,3
25 kilos each huh,3
15 6gigs here90 gigs totalother ship carries 20gig cells sofive five total to launch,3
how many,3
okay that should buy us a syscheck but well need more cells,3
nothing we cant repair so long as the electrical adapts,3
little rattyass,3
thanks for the tip johns,3
you said it not me lets just not let one bad call lead to another,3
what you think im doin this to prove something,3
hey bein ballsy with your life now doesnt change what came before its just stupid,3
nobody else is going down but me okay,3
i dont but that ground looked none too stable and i dont want anyone,3
thought you didnt believe his story,3
well dont ask me to,3
uwere gonna find the bodyu johns christ youre a cop why am i tellin you this we gotta go down and find it,3
i uamu sure look murders aside riddick belongs in the asshole hall of fame he loves the jawjackin loves making you afraid cuz thats all he has and youre playing right into,3
lets just be sure,3
i uknowu what happened he went off on the guy buried him on the hill somewhere and now hes trying to,3
i assume he licked it clean,3
so why isnt it all bloody,3
sir shivalot he likes to cut,3
he used that,3
ease up ease up johns just tell me what,3
i dont play thati dont play that so just try again cmon riddick tell me a better lie,3
like my pistola,3
like what,3
sorry thought i heard something,3
shut up,3
no juice looks like its been laid up for years but we might be able to adapt,3
thought he might be coolin it in the boneyard could either doubleback to the ship or slip in behind us so i left the bottle out as bait,3
what,3
didnt bite,3
fuck guess im more glad to be here than i thought,3
so now you know,3
during the landingwhen things were at their worstowens was at his best hes the one who wouldnt let the pilot dump the passenger cabin,3
you see anybody else here just between you and me,3
promise me swear to me you wont,3
hey you can tell me carolyn,3
whatd owens mean bout not touching the switch,3
better keep moving,3
so i noticed never seen a captain quite so ready to leave her ship,3
no no i wanted to get away,3
probably right,3
probably makes it worse dehydrates you even more,3
tell me its not a mirage,3
what,3
which means he went toward sunrise,3
thought you found his restraints over there toward sunset,3
a very good sign thats riddicks direction you do unotu wanna be caught in the dark with this guy,3
little swampflu from the conga system never shook it with all this cryosleep,3
smatter,3
only around humans,3
i dont need his life story is he really that dangerous,3
be my choice already escaped once from the maxslam facility on,3
we just keep him locked up forever,3
big evil,3
and him,3
carolyn fry id shake hands but,3
amazing im johns,3
hey me over here,3
hey who,3
hey,3
johns is leaving you a gun just do me a favor huh get my crewies buried they were good guys who died bad,3
what youre goin off too,3
imam we should leave soon before nightfall but while its cooler,3
ask if anyone has anything in cargo anything to drink,3
well is it just the pump,3
somethin knocked us offlane maybe a rogue comet maybe well never know,3
so what the bloody hell happened anyways,3
its the atmosphere too much pressure not enough oxygen might take a few days to,3
70 seconds you still got 70 seconds to level this beast out,3
owens,3
and there wasnt a simulated cockroach alive within 50 clicks of the simulated crash site uthatsu how they train you on a fucking simulator,3
when captain went down you stepped up whether you like it or not now they train you for this so,3
companys not here is it,3
look fry company says were responsible for every one of those,3
so what we should both go down too out of sheer fucking nobility,3
you mean that load of passengers,3
cant get my nose downtoo much load back there,3
fry,3
just tell me were still in the shipping lane just show me all those stars all those bright beautiful deepspace,3
1550 millibars dropping 20 mb per minute shit were hemorrhaging air usomethinu took a swipe at us,3
oh no not owens not wai wai wait uim owensu right,3
you hear me captains dead owens too,3
i mean i mean chrono shows were 22 weeks out so gravity wasnt supposed to kick in for another 19 i mean i mean i mean why did i fall uat allu,3
hes dead capns dead christ i was looking right at him when,3
why did i fall on you,3
rain,3
oh no no no no,3
and what about the cells,3
the sled as a shield,3
do what i say please,3
i would rather we all stay,3
dont stop just slow down little more space tween us and them,3
what,3
imam slow down,3
no im not but uheu can,3
and youre certain you can find the way back even in the dark,3
theyre afraid of our light that means we dont have to be so afraid of them,3
riddick,3
hasan,3
quiet please everyone,3
i saw the cutmarks on the bones wasnt a natural dieoff,3
for now,3
one is all,3
were all on the same hajj now,3
frightening thought,3
chrislam teaches that once in every lifetime should there be a great hajj a great pilgrimage to know god better yes but to know yourself as well,3
you were on a pilgrimage to new mecca,3
some prophet guy and a city man but he had to travel to the desert where there was quiet to hear the words of god,3
some prophet guy,3
you know who muhammad was,3
so quiet you get used to the sounds of the ship then,3
one of the christian habits we udidntu adopt perhaps unfortunately well have to wait,3
i dont suppose,3
its more a place where souls are found mr riddick,3
think a soul could get lost there with all those pilgrimtypes,3
new mecca,3
keep going or i will,3
suleiman,3
get the girl back under keep going,3
suleiman,3
give my blessing to the girl she needs a spare,3
he will be with us nonetheless,3
cuz you dont spend half your life in lockdown with a horsebit in your mouth and not believe and you surely dont start out in a liquor store trash bin with an umbilical cord wrapped around your neck and not believe oh absolutely i believe in god and i absolutely hate the fucker,3
you udontu see,3
i see well even if you dont believe in god it doesnt mean he wont be,3
and pointless,3
blessing you like the others its painless,3
whatre you doin,3
you mean,3
which half,3
wheres mr johns,3
there is no safe,3
wellwe must keep her close then here shell be safe if we put her between,3
has anyone checked the coring room,3
has anyone seen the young one ali,3
listen to her uheru when she was willing to sacrifice us all,3
shes the captain we should listen to,3
hes running us round in circles look for yourself look,3
we crossed our own tracks,3
pleasethis solves nothingplease,3
oh trash baby youre gonna regret this,3
those suns gotta come back usometimeu and if these animals really are phobic about light we just sit tight till then,3
i had the impressionfrom the model that the two planets were moving as one that there would bea lasting darkness,3
the child heard you before any of us could even,3
we got youits okay its okaywe got you now,3
im bornagain,3
god is great yes,3
all deserts have water somewhere god shall lead us there,3
for what there is no water you understand that dont you,3
oh so im disposable,3
shes the pilot she should stay close to the cells,3
not staying in here another,3
very big beads,3
like an emergency liferaft right,3
well just a skiff disposable really,3
didnt say that but least this way i dont have to worry about falling asleep and not wakin up,3
so just like that wave your little wand and hes one of us now,3
maratha crowbill warpicks from northern india very rare,3
what the hell are these,3
ill need a receipt for that for all these,3
a toast to whatever he just said,3
be surprised what these will fetch in the taurus system here this wooten here easy easy very rare,3
king tuts tomb,3
anyone else having breathing problems aside from me,3
then we saw this,3
like who mr chrislam,3
just wonderin if we dont need a bigger piece of chum,3
aw dont tell me youre growin scruples,3
oh youre a piece of art johns they oughtta hang you in a museum somewhere or forget the museum maybe they should just hang you,3
whats one more to you like uthisu is the one that sends you to hell,3
what you spect umeu to do it,3
then lets not name the thanksgiving turkey okay i assume you still got a shiv,3
what do you care,3
whats her name anyway,3
don look don look don look,3
so which one caught your eye,3
dont wanna feed these landsharks just keep em off our scent,3
nice embellishment,3
utrawlu with it theres a cable on the sled we can drag the body behind us,3
sacrifice play hack up one body leave it at start of the canyon like a bucket of chum,3
either way figure its something you can grab onto,3
kept calling it murder when i did it,3
look its hellified stuff but no different than those battlefield doctors when they have to decide who lives and who dies its called triage okay,3
what if youre one of five,3
not if im the one,3
six of us left if we could get through that canyon and lose just one thatd be quite a fucking feat huh a good thing right,3
just realized that huh,3
aint all of us gonna make it,3
they been noseopen for her ever since we left they go off blood,3
aw this cant be happening to me,3
no shes not,3
whatre you jawjackin about girls not cut,3
about the girl,3
about how to kill us and still get these cells to the skiff goddamnit were just doin the heavy lifting for this prick,3
hard to tell sometimeseven for me but looked like a bunch of those big boys chewin each others gonads off thought wed swing wide okay by you,3
such as,3
looks clear,3
well whats it look like now,3
said looks clear,3
ufuck meu you said clear,3
how bout a cut in your gut,3

id rather piss glass,3
not afraid of the dark are you,3
are you fuckin kidding me,3
if you were me id kill us both cmon you wanna sit at the grownup table or not,3
my recommendation do me dont take the chance that ill get shivhappy on your wannabe ass ghost me riddick would if i were you,3
only if we both get outta this alive and there may be a way,3
youd cut me loose boss,3
truth is riddick im tired of this headup shit i wanna be free of you as much as you wanna be free of me,3
for what the honor of goin back to some asshole of a cell,3
heres the deal you work without the chains without the bit without the shivs you help us get off this rock,3
say that again,3
want you to remember this moment riddick the way it coulda gone and didnt,3
were movin and im just wondering if i shouldnt lighten the load right now,3
found somethin worse than me huh,3
well just keep your bloodyfuckin eyes open dont want that ratbag sneakin up on me bloodyfuckin arse,3
amazing how you can do without the essentials of life so long as you have the luxuries,3
so much for my cocktail hour,3
so much for your nightfall,3
well whats the need anyway if hes gone hes gone why should he bother us,3
cuz they couldnt hunt shit with these things be my guess,3
blowdart hunting stick from papua new guinea very uveryu rare since the tribes extinct,3
an this,3
startin to acclimate anyhow take it,3
what its broken,3
take it,3
just wanted his o2 though i notice he tried to ghost my ass when he shot up that stranger instead,3
you were tryin to kill him too,3
i know you dont uncrate your emergency ship unless theres a fucking emergency,3
maybe they had weight limits you dont know,3
what you dont really think they left with their clothes on the lines photos on the walls,3
doesnt need to be use this to get back up to the soltrack shipping lanes stick out a thumb youll get picked up right,3
not a starjumper,3
thats correct and you will both stand trial for heresy,3
seal the cave,3
well for a time the ancients kept humans as household pets	until the lawgiver proved that man could not be tamed keep digging cornelius youll find evidence of the master of this house an ape,3
no sir i havent forgotten,3
your conclusion is premature have you forgotten your scripture the thirteenth scroll and proteus brought the upright beast into the garden and chained him to a tree and the children made sport of him,3
a doll alone proves nothing true but the doll was found beside the jawbone of a man and no trace of simian fossils has turned up in this deposit,3
to begin with your methods of dating the past are crude to say the least there are geologists on my staff who would laugh at your speculations,3
i apologize,3
dont speak to me in absolutes the evidence is contestable,3
indeed the very fact that these tools are unknown to us could suggest a culture in certain ways almost equal to our own some of the evidence is uncontestable,3
ive seen some of your fossils and artifacts theyre worthless,3
weve never meant to be treasonable sir but up there in the face of that cliff is a vast cave and in that cave a fabulous treasure of fossils and artifacts,3
i ask you to reconsider the rash course youve taken if youre convicted of heresy the most youll get is two years but if you persist in pointing guns in my direction youll hang for high treason,3
it wasnt difficult only an apostate or a lunatic would flee to the forbidden zone i see you brought along the female of your species i didnt realize a man could be monogamous,3
how did you know wed come here,3
yes sir so it was thanks to you but not before i discovered evidence of a simian culture that existed long before the sacred scrolls were written,3
he exceeded his orders his travel permit was promptly revoked,3
certainly sir its a pleasure to see you again,3
you know dr maximus our commissioner for animal affairs,3
oh no sir i was just assembling my notes,3
did you forget our appointment cornelius,3
dr zaius,3
certainly sir ill get my notes and come right over,3
cornelius if you have a moment today id like to discuss this expedition of yours in more detail,3
good luck then,3
they cant convict us of that you proved our innocence besides his culture is our culture,3
and now you know the truth cornelius has beaten you doctor he proved it man preceded you here you owe him your science your language whatever knowledge you have,3
that was different we thought you were inferior,3
reconstructing a life care to have a look,3
what are you doing there,3
yes i have to agree from all youve found so far his positions as good as yours,3
no you saved me from this fanatic maybe i can pay you back,3
taylor id rather you,3
shut up,3
taylor youre not in command here put down that gun,3
if theres any shooting dr zaius youll be the first to die depend on it,3
right now if you like,3
when are you going to show me whats in the cave,3
no one really knows its an ancient taboo set forth in the sacred scrolls the lawgiver pronounced the area deadly,3
youve never told me why this regions called the forbidden zone,3
it empties into a sea some miles from here thats where the cave is,3
where does the river lead,3
i know nevertheless i thank you for saving us youll be in trouble for going there,3
sorry taylor the terrain around that lake is poisonous there is no fresh water no vegetation nothing,3
nothing much the remnants of a life raft maybe a small flag the emblem of my countrymen,3
its a long detour to dead lake what would we find,3
you still dont believe me do you,3
to the diggings i worked at a year ago its a three day ride across the eastern desert near where you claim you landed from that planet of yours,3
zaius seems to think there might be another jungle beyond the forbidden zone thats what well try for what about you,3
as you wish,3
just the same i want one,3
the best but we wont need them,3
do you have any weapons,3
well taylor were all fugitives now,3
right lets put the water and provisions in the wagon,3
wed better get started if the mounted police pick up our trail theyll come this far at least,3
there was one bad moment some hunters stopped us,3
how did it go,3
zira,3
a toy it floats on the air try it,3
zira listen to me weve got a fine future ahead of us marriage stimulating careers im up for a raise,3
oh cornelius show some strength,3
no thank you i wont get into that battle,3
well maybe theyre not,3
because if he is a missing link it means the sacred scrolls arent worth their parchment,3
i am not a missing link,3
how can scientific truth be heresy what if taylor is exactly the proof you needed a mutation a missing link between the unevolved primate and the ape,3
that was before dr zaius and half the academy said the idea was heresy,3
you didnt think so then,3
the evidence was very meager,3
that the ape evolved from a lower order of primate possibly man in his trip to the forbidden zone he discovered traces of a culture older than recorded time,3
its probably wrong,3
cornelius has developed a brilliant hypothesis,3
no they wont,3
dont be foolish if its true theyll have to accept it,3
zira are you trying to get my head cut off,3
but what about your theory the existence of someone like taylor might prove it,3
i dont and im not going to try,3
then how do you account for me,3
no creature can survive in that part of the forbidden zone ive been there ive seen it,3
cornelius why do you insist on provoking him,3
and even if it werent why fly where would it get you,3
flight is a scientific impossibility,3
and they fell out of the sky with you,3
dodge was killed in the hunt what happened to landon i dont know,3
oh cornelius be quiet,3
now just a minute,3
where did you learn to do this,3
dear youre a scientist dont you believe your own eyes,3
its a stunt humans dont write,3
zira come on you know they cant oh oh here comes number one,3
the blood transfusion,3
remembers what,3
look she remembers,3
watch hello bright eyes hows our throat today,3
whats so special about him,3
thats bright eyes the one i was telling you about,3
neither do i,3
no,3
do you have to work tonight,3
blessed are the vegetarians,3
well at least they havent tried to bite us,3
lets find them all,3
where theres one theres another and another and another,3
youre more than three hundred light years from your precious planet your loved ones have been dead and forgotten for twenty centuries even if you could get back theyd think you were something that fell out of a tree,3
taylor quit riding him,3
none at all,3
any particular reason,3
that way,3
which direction,3
okay if theres no life here weve got just seventytwo hours to find it thats when the groceries run out,3
no,3
any sign of dangerous ionization,3
nothing will grow here theres just a trace of hydrocarbons and most of the nitrogen is locked into nitrates,3
good question landon check your communications kit,3
but how long is a day,3
one pistol twentyfour rounds of ammo two medical kits one camera one tx9 weve enough food and water for three days,3
yo,3
geiger counter,3
yo,3
got your sensors,3
theyre still dirty and their bite is septic look at that,3
the foundations of scientific brain surgery are being laid right here in studies of cerebral function in these animals,3
hmph,3
thats because dr zaius realizes our work has value,3
you do pretty well when it comes to getting space and equipment,3
what do you mean made it im an animal psychologist thats all we dont have any authority,3
but the quota systems been abolished you made it why cant i,3
these animals are dirty doctor they stink and they carry communicable diseases why arent they cleaned up before theyre brought here,3
this place is dirty doctor,3
i dont know this beast lost a lot of blood,3
will he live,3
him,3
which one was wearing the strange clothes,3
be it so ordered the tribunal will examine all the evidence presented here and in due time render a verdict on the proposed indictment and on the disposition of the deviate in question this hearing is adjourned,3
yes sir the state charges doctors zira and cornelius with contempt of this tribunal malicious mischief and scientific heresy,3
sustained,3
objection,3
sustained your archeological theories have no bearing on the disposition of this creature,3
objection these remarks are profane and irrelevant,3
very well i suggest we go and look at them,3
thats true dr zaius my witnesses correction my exhibits are on display in the amphitheater,3
proceed but dont turn this hearing into a farce,3
he can reason with the tribunals permission let me expose this hoax by direct examination,3
directly mr president this wretched man the accused is only a pawn in the conspiracy we know that he was wounded in the throat at the time of his capture the state charges that dr zira and a corrupt surgeon named galen experimented on this wounded animal tampering with his brain and throat tissues to create a speaking monster,3
come to the point dr honorius,3
there is a conspiracy afoot to undermine the very cornerstone of our faith,3
learned judges my case is simple it is based on our first article of faith that the almighty created the ape in his own image that he gave him a soul and a mind that he set him apart from the beasts of the jungle and made him the lord of the planet,3
state your case mr prosecutor,3
well dr zira this is a man is he not,3
objection the accused is indeed a man therefore he has no rights under ape law,3
show this to the president,3
ridiculous that answer is a contradiction in terms tell us bright eyes why do men have no souls what is the proof that a divine spark exists in the simian brain,3
some apes it seems are more equal than others,3
of course he doesnt know our culture because he cannot think tell us why all apes are created equal,3
i admit i know nothing of your culture,3
tell the court bright eyes what is the second article of faith,3
do as i say,3
hes vicious doctor besides its against the rules,3
get me a collar and leash im taking him to the infirmary,3
ill see,3
those fools and their torches do you have any ointment,3
what happened,3
well you know what they say human see human do,3
hes trying to form words,3
huh,3
did you see that its remarkable,3
see he keeps pretending he can talk,3
awww it still hurts doesnt it,3
dont be silly hes perfectly tame,3
you could get hurt doing that doctor,3
no change the minute you open the door he goes into his act,3
good morning julius hows our patient today,3
good morning dr zira,3
youre our optimist look at the bright side if thats the best there is around here in six months well be running this planet,3
we got off at the wrong stop,3
try telling them our names,3
no cigar,3
okay,3
can we take a dip,3
lets take a look,3
scarecrows,3
id like to know why not you thought life on earth was meaningless you despised people so what did you do you ran away,3
but im not prepared to die,3
dodge hes not like me at all but he makes sense held walk naked into a live volcano if he thought he could learn something no other man knew i understand why hes here but youyoure no seeker youre negative,3
dont bother,3
okay you read me well enough why cant i read you,3
oh and one last item immortality you wanted to go on forever well you damn near made it except for dodge and me youve lived longer than anybody and with stewart dead it looks like were the last of the strain you got what you wanted kid how does it taste,3
taylor	im telling you,3
and the glory dont forget that theres a lifesized bronze statue of you somewhere its probably turned green by now and nobody can read the name plate but never let it be said we forget our heroes,3
climb off me will you,3
straighten me out on something why did you come along at all you volunteered why ill tell you they nominated you for the big one and you couldnt turn it down not without losing your allamerican standing,3
im prepared to die,3
theres only one reality left were here and its now you get ahold of that and hang on tight or you might as well be dead,3
all right,3
what would you learn ive told you where you are and when you are,3
if only we could get a fix,3
its a fact landon buy it youll sleep better,3
prove it if we cant get back its still just a theory,3
because time has wiped out everyone and everything you cared for theyre dust,3
long pause you know it,3
apart from that you look pretty chipper for a man whos two thousand and thirty one years old i read the clocks they bear out hassleins hypothesis weve been away from earth for two thousand years give or take a decade still cant accept it huh,3
by our time youve turned gray,3
then weve been away from earth for eighteen months,3
its a little late for a wake shes been dead nearly a year,3
you dont seem very cut up about it,3
air leak died in her sleep,3
sorry i was thinking of stewart what dyou suppose happened,3
landon join the expedition,3
were some three hundred and twenty light years from earth on an unnamed planet in orbit around a star in the constellation of orion that could be bellatrix,3
well where are we have any notion skipper,3
were here to stay,3
gone,3
forget it abandon ship,3
its no use there she goes,3
to earth that weve landed,3
what signal,3
landon send a last signal,3
the flags of discontent its the only way anything ever gets changed dont try to follow us im pretty handy with things like this,3
what,3
thats the boy keep em flying,3
i think youre making a mistake,3
lucius,3
ill start by following the shoreline and my nose,3
they think youre behaving foolishly i must say i agree where will you go,3
yes i can do that,3
i want you to go around the bend and tell those gorillas their leader is my prisoner,3
what is it,3
all right all right will you do me a favor no orders,3
disillusioned but vindicated ive been right all along you cant trust the older generation its a matter of values,3
not everything they left a hostage how do you feel lucius,3
relax youll see it all later,3
always giving orders just like every other adult,3
sorry lucius youll have to stay here and guard the horses,3
in my world before i left it only youngsters of your age wore un scraped hair,3
why did you do that scrape off your hair,3
im for that,3
shouldnt we be moving on,3
fine just let her out,3
if you insist but im not taking any orders,3
i want her,3
zira doesnt want your female,3
she comes along too,3
come on get me out of here,3
so you can talk im dr ziras nephew this abduction was her idea youre not really going to the zoo thats just our cover story in case were stopped although i do feel that if it ever came down to a question of whether something like you should be public or private property,3
who are you,3
to scare off humans,3
the hunt club,3
who put them up,3
keep moving we cant turn back now,3
gorilla hunters,3
all right get inhurry put this on,3
he wouldnt leave her,3
i told you not to bring the other one,3
at the very least this man has the right to know whether theres a charge against him,3
and our purpose is to settle custodial and jurisdictional questions concerning this beast and determine whats to be done with him,3
my own purpose is to save this exceptional creature from mutilation,3
you asked for the opportunity to present your case surely you must know why youre here,3
were conducting a new experiment,3
why special,3
yes sir but this creature is a special case,3
i know its a man and you know the rules no animals outside the compound and most certainly not without a leash,3
a man dr maximus,3
what is that,3
bailiff stop this outburst gag that monstrosity,3
you destroyed his memory his mind his identity and you want to do the same to me,3
dr zira silence that man,3
one is in a museum,3
bailiff make the animal be quiet,3
this hearing is absurd let me tell my story,3
it says here that his name is bright eyes you gave him that name yourself,3
my name is taylor,3
dr zira tell bright eyes to sit down,3
sustain all objections but face the truth,3
sustained,3
let us assume as common sense dictates that the prisoners story is false but if he does not come from another planet then surely he sprang from our own yes sprang as an animal psychologist i have found no physiological defect to explain why humans are mute,3
how so,3
is it a joke to seek the truth about this man,3
this is a joke in very poor taste,3
stop right there bring me that paper,3
i have come to you from a planet in a different solar system i am an explorer in space with no hostile intentions against your civilization on my planet it was the primate man who evolved into a thinking animal while the apes remained,3
read it yourself,3
since the defendant is forbidden to speak in his own defense he asks that this statement be read into the record,3
did we create his mind too not only can this man speak he can write he can reason,3
mind your tongue madame,3
that??s a lie,3
then why is he called the accused your honors must think him guilty of something,3
sustained in all fairness dr zira you must admit the accused is a nonape and therefore has no rights under ape law,3
by your leave mr president the tribunal has not yet defined the purpose of this inquiry,3
let it be clear at the outset that all matters pertaining to this inquiry are confidential and anyone discussing them outside this chamber will be held in contempt of the tribunal you may proceed dr honorius,3
dont look for it taylor you may not like what you find,3
were back at the beginning i still dont know the why a planet where apes evolved from men a world turned wrong side up a puzzle with one piece missing,3
the forbidden zone was once a paradise your breed made a desert of it ages ago,3
what evidence no weapons were found in the cave,3
because you are a man and you were right i have always known about man from the evidence i believe his wisdom must walk hand in hand with his idiocy his emotions must rule his brain he must be a warlike animal who gives battle to everything around him even himself,3
why from the first ive terrified you doctor and in spite of every sign that im an intelligent being who means no harm you continue to hate and fear me why,3
no thanks ill take freedom,3
where else but in a cage does man belong,3
sure	in a cage,3
of course you could return with us our society might find a place for you and your mate,3
then there is another jungle,3
he might have been wiped out by a plague natural catastrophe like a fiery storm of meteors from the looks of this part of your planet id say that was a fair bet,3
then answer this if ran was superior why didnt he survive,3
cease fire withdraw,3
tell him to pull back,3
thats lunacy i can give an alternate description for everyone of those objects thats equally as inventive as yours but it would be conjecture not proof,3
i dont say he was a man like an earthman but id call him a close relative for he was plagued by most of mans ills yet fragile as he was he came before you and was superior to you,3
okayup to the cave,3
of course,3
very well if zira and cornelius can prove that those scrolls dont tell the whole truth of your history if they can show you definite evidence of another culture from an unrecorded past will you exonerate them,3
twelve hundred years ago,3
when were the sacred scrolls written,3
what is your proposal,3
all right lets see if youre willing to put that statement to a test,3
there is no contradiction between faith and science true science,3
dont be a fool youre outnumbered and outgunned,3
stop right there,3
youre a menace a walking pestilence i do know who you are taylor as i know that others of your kind must live in the forbidden zone you have just six hours to make a full confession after that ill employ surgery to obtain one guards,3
im not protecting anybody that hearing was a farce what have i done,3
if you are protecting others of your kind it will cost you your identity,3
i dont know,3
you may well call it upside down since you occupy its lowest level and deservedly the eastern desert has never been explored because weve always assumed that no life can exist there save yourself taylor tell me is there another jungle beyond the forbidden zone,3
thank you for calling me taylor dr zaius i know who i am who are you how did this upside down civilization ever get started,3
i admit that where theres one mutant theres probably another and another a nest of them wheres your nest taylor where are your women,3
then you admit,3
because youre not unique there was the one you call landon,3
all right suppose i am a mutant why does the appearance of one mutant send you into a panic,3
of course,3
thats exactly what zira and cornelius claim youre talking heresy doctor,3
certainly not	youre a mutant,3
i take it you dont believe the prosecutors charge that im a monster created by dr zira,3
a fort unconsciously you chose a name that was belligerent where were you nurtured,3
what about it,3
then how is it we speak the same language even in your lies some truth slips through that mythical community youre supposed to come from fort wayne,3
my tribe as you call it lives on another planet in a distant solar system,3
you lied where is your tribe,3
i told the truth at that hearingof yours,3
however its within my power to grant you a reprieve that is why i summoned you here tonight tell me who and what you really are and where you come from and no veterinary will touch you,3
emasculation to begin with then experimental surgery on the speech centers on the brain ultimately a kind of living death,3
no,3
oh your case was preordained in a way you performed a service for the state because your hearing made it possible for us to expose zira and cornelius and now the tribunal has placed you in my custody forfinal disposition do you know what that means,3
what about me,3
identify him then speak to him,3
with one of them,3
welldo you acknowledge kinship with any of these creatures,3
god bless you,3
go with god taylor thats an old expression it comes from both ape and man,3
all right but youre so damned ugly,3
dr zira id like to kiss you goodbye,3
its better than going to prison for heresy,3
we cant,3
would you like to come along,3
wasnt i humiliated by all of you didnt you lead me around on a leash,3
its humiliating,3
why not,3
taylor please dont treat him that way,3
taylor you cant,3
then tell them dr zaius wont leave here alive,3
he has a point on my planet children often play with ape dolls,3
taylor tell him,3
except that hes also the chief defender of the faith,3
taylor please,3
and thats your minister of science honor bound to expand the frontiers of knowledge,3
shes not sick at all shes pregnant,3
whats the diagnosis doctor a touch of the sun,3
you threw us together remember and you guessed right men like apes get despondent without a mate,3
you want her that much,3
maybe not,3
actually youre a different breed this creature will never evolve,3
yes,3
are you going to take her with you,3
youre going back to the forbidden zone,3
cornelius and i have been indicted for heresy unless we can prove our theories we dont stand a chance of acquittal,3
taylor just keep quiet and we may get away with this remember that men all look alike to most apes,3
listen,3
you did this to him youve removed his frontal lobes,3
no i swear i never saw this man before,3
you you knew about this,3
second from the left,3
which one,3
its himlandon,3
a hearing,3
what is this,3
shhhh,3
where have you been why didnt you come to see me,3
dr zaius i could have sworn he was answering you,3
im not acting i can talk how much proof do you want,3
there can you believe it i looks like hes talking,3
my name isnt bright eyes its taylor,3
speak go on	speak again,3
listen listen i can speak,3
well bright eyes is our throat feeling better,3
in a few minutes there will be no doll there cant be im sorry,3
but the proof the doll,3
he wont survive do you know what sort of life awaits you out there taylor that of an animal if you arent eventually hunted down and killed by apes some jungle beast will devour you,3
but suppose you find nothing but a wasteland how will you survive,3
what,3
but theres the doll sir,3
secondly if these tools as you call them are unidentified why are they introduced as evidence of anything,3
sirs our theories have a bearing on his identity,3
let them talk mr president let them talk,3
mr president i believe the prosecutor has reassembled all he surviving humans captured in the hunt along with bright eyes,3
he doesnt know,3
how sad stuffed and mounted eh dead men like sunken ships can tell no stories and his other companion,3
where are they now,3
this is his assertion,3
but how convenient that the proof of his arrival has vanished you also state that bright eyes had two intelligent companions at the time of his capture,3
like you i find it difficult,3
do you believe him,3
i do not state it sir the prisoner does,3
dr zira you state here that a ship from outer space sank in an inland sea of our eastern desert,3
yes sir,3
wouldnt it more properly be done in your office,3
but perhaps he understood,3
of course he saw you moving yours,3
hes moving his fingers,3
kill you motherfucker,2
i shit on all o you,3
yeah back about 100 metres hes dead now get going the gooks are all over the fuckin place,3
hes dead where you saw him,3
elias is dead join up with the platoon move it,3
ill get him you get the man in taylor now or ill article 15 both your asses move,3

maybe youre going to have to like me,3
i dont like being referred to as babe or addressed as baby i dont like your possessive attitude nor your hints of secret knowledge in fact to be very frank mr mitchell i dont think i like you,3
how careful should i be,3
please be a little more careful how you talk mr mitchell,3
why certainly baby,3
i think id like to dance,3
how do you do,3
betty this is margo west she wants to meet you miss mayfield,3
if i change my mind,3
if you change your mind about the cocktail party or anything else give me a buzz,3
okay you win,3
would you mind,3
dont i even get my face slapped,3
im trying very hard to be polite about it,3
the brushoff huh,3
nobody id rather have on a leash,3
perhaps id better get you straightened out mr mitchell youve been rather nice to me in a couple of ways and im grateful but i dont think this entitles you to put me on a leash,3
nobody gets invited to clark brandons parties they just go,3
i havent been invited,3
well how about a breeze up to the penthouse about six oclock a friend of mine is throwing a cocktail party up there,3
im sure you have,3
we have some nice places around vancouver,3
im not in the mood for dining and dancing,3
whats the matter,3
not tonight,3
dine and dance tonight ive got fifty bucks to throw away,3
dont get me wrong betty im not suggesting you murdered anybody you know,3
,3
how about taking to uncle larry into the old firm hes a useful guy to have on your side,3
yes,3
i have a darned good idea youre name isnt betty mayfield at all,3
i think youre a nice girl i like you but i can read signs if the print is large enough it was your manner more than the wedding ring that bothered the inspector a sort of tenseness as if you were afraid of something,3
im supposing,3
suppose i hadnt known that immigration inspector hadnt put in a good word for you,3
thank you,3
no thanks,3
very nice mitchell turns,3
nice room balcony and everything lovely view too,3
you dont know,3
i dont know,3
indefinitely,3
i really dont know,3
a very small service it doesnt even ask for thanks how long for,3
well,3
ill make one for you i live there,3
is it i expected to go to the vancouver royal should i have a reservation,3
where are you staying in vancouver royal its pretty crowded you know,3
perhaps i dont take it so lightly,3
or reno they always throw them off the bridge there ive heard,3
im going to vancouver mr mitchell,3
vancouver bc,3
how far does this train go,3
you could tell me your name and where youre going,3
im afraid theres nothing i can do about it mr mitchell,3
same as an hour ago remember im the steady type,3
my names larry mitchell i live in vancouver,3
no thanks ive seen seattle,3
possibly miss,3
they might think i was running away from something,3
crossing the border this time of night theyre a bit particular youd have to prove your identity you know unless youve got a passport they might even want to know why youre in such a hurry otherwise they might think,3
immigration officer,3
well they have to service the plane and get a pilot down to the field unless theres one hanging around there still and then they have to get the immigration officer,3
how long would that take,3
im afraid theres nothing more tonight miss unless you charter a plane,3
how soon can i get a plane to seattle,3
good evening miss,3
im carrying quite a large sum in travelers checks how much of a deposit would you like,3
merely for our records miss mayfield its usual for the guests who come here for the first time,3
bank,3
im mr campbell miss mayfield purely as a matter of routine i want to ask the name of your bank,3
im miss mayfield is mr campbell here,3
good morning can i do something for you,3
if i didi dontnow,3
do you think i was faking,3
i think you mean that,3
yes you youre not really a murderer yet,3
me,3
if it has to bedo you mind if i do it myself oh i dont mean with the gun this is no trick when i wrote that note you have in your pocket that was no trick either its not so hard for me as you think im not crying about it ive been skating close to it for quite some time the water is cold down there but so is everything else and theres you,3
this is it betty theyll find us again fog or no fog,3
shut up cut it out even if i have to kill both of us,3
every day of your life youll want me youll never get over it every time you see your face in the mirror,3
would i want to,3
but the next one is murder first the little step then the longer step and then the step you can never take back you could tell about mitchell you could tell about magruderand the detective it would hurt but you could do it you could never tell about me,3
you think magruder wants to hang beside me,3
magruder does,3
whod believe it but you i took him out to sea and threw him in the water even if they find him what connects him with me,3
and that nasty man that followed us last night you didnt kill him,3
mitchell was dead enough,3
yes yours you havent murdered anybody you killed mitchell wasnt that an accident it must have been if you kill a blackmailer you kill him deadso that he cant talk anymore,3
mine,3
and im begging for my lifeand yours,3
it wasnt the time or place dont worry about the note baby im playing for my neck now,3
im still on course to victoria nobody saw you get on board nobody seen you since,3
youll never make it youve out smarted yourself,3
so that i will never be found,3
dont go soft on me baby ive got your note in my pocket you wrote it all by your own self and i have to use it it has to be found in exactly the right place,3
i guess im a little screwy maybe i could believe it should i try,3
magruder obliged me no use my saying it wasnt planned that way i had to clean up im not a dumb smart college boy anymore nobody in the world would believe i didnt plan the whole thing,3
youkilledhim,3
not this one and not mitchell,3
hell come backthey always come back when you give them money,3
no i paid him off,3
that man that was following us last nighthe didnt come back this morning im beginning to wonder about him too was he really following meor you,3
it buys things just like any other kind,3
the money that makes you mr clark brandon lets you live in a penthouse on top of the vancouver royal lets you own a cruiser lets you do as you please go where you please you big openhanded generous guy thats the kind of money it takes isnt it,3
nobody believed i wasnt in on it i was just a dumbsmart collage boy and he was my father i thought it was a legitimate business he was a politician with fingers in a lot of pies i never saw the pies they had names for the record innocent names you know where that kind of money comes from dont you,3
what your father did doesnt condemn you,3
so could you but our records were a little against us,3
if it was an accident you could have told the truth,3
in a way,3
larry mitchell found out so you killed him,3
i told you my father died in jail he stole a fortune most of it pretty dirty money i dont care to have that known,3
including killainei still cant think of you that way,3
including killaine,3
funny i never thought of you that way you were so close too we were all pretty stupid about you,3
thats right,3
i thought you had to be back to the hotel to leave mymy note,3
that and the fun of it,3
if youre doing all this just for me,3
wonder what,3
i decided i didnt want a drinkim beginning to wonder,3
go down into the cabin and get yourself a drink careful how you go were hitting the swell now,3
frozen,3
cold,3
there would be a moon tonight,3
i can still see the shoreline the moon is rising,3
see anything,3
killaines wise to what,3
killaines wise we cant wait any longer here put this on but stay out of sight until we clear the harbor ill tell you when,3
you leave it,3
well,3
my father died in jail and he was twice the man i am,3
you wouldnt like it ive been there,3
id still go througheven if i ended up in jail,3
its the frame on the picture but not if you say so,3
do you have to leave the note,3
it did but it never paid off until now i ought to be back within an hour we cant leave until near dark anyway,3
this must have cost a fortune,3
youll be safe here i wont be long help yourself to anything you want the galleys through there you can make coffee if you like,3
the best interference runner weve got he thinks hes in love with youand hes a gentleman come here baby,3
killaine,3
if they had any reason to why make it tough for themselves why go to all that trouble heres an open book close it no reason to keep it open she was a nice girl anyway and perhaps she didnt kill him on purpose perhaps she didnt kill the other one you never know give her the benefit of the doubt leave her stay where she is close the book finis,3
but thats what im doing couldnt they think of that,3
blonde beautiful and sadand nowhere of course she might have run awayif she knew how and where to go she might have dyed her hair bleached it before probably and changed her name again but look at this note and look at her room in the hotel her stuff is all there hasnt a rag except what she stood up in you dont run away like that not if you are young and beautiful no chance,3
and betty mayfield,3
i run over to victoria play some golf with some people i know do it all the time thats why i have a cabin cruiser custom builtforty knots mr clark brandon an almost gentleman of almost complete leisure member of six golf clubs broke 70 once on the shaughnessy heights course you have to be good to do that and if you look out of a front window of the empress hotel in victoria in a few hours you can look right down on mr brandons boat the valkyrie came alone sure he always comes alone mr brandons a rather lonely man,3
theyll look for you,3
this is the ace betty but not of spades theyll find out about the other they might know already and when they get this what would they look for where out there somewhere,3
i was tried for murdering my husband guilty the judge set the verdict aside there was one man on the jury but he was afraid they were all afraidof my fatherinlaw that man followed me last night he came from him of course my fatherinlaw will never give up never he promised me that so i came to vancouver bc as far away as i can get from north carolina and it happens all over again almost the same thing almost the same way do you wonder about this,3
how bad is the other thing the secret,3
take me where i havent the courage to take myself,3
yes ive never been very far from it for a long time will you do something for me,3
how bad is it bad enough for,3
that wasnt why i called you why did i hopewhen i hadnt any right to hope,3
theres a lot of water between vancouver and the usa this note is a suicide note after youre gone where would they look for you why would they look for you darkness and open water and a fast cabin cruiser and i have a pocket full of money and if i helped you id be committing a crime or so they tell me,3
wrote it in the waiting room of the hudson bay store with somebodys pekingese trying to climb into my lap perhaps youre right perhaps i didnt mean it all i know is that im licked,3
if you meant it you wouldnt show it to me betty or am i supposed to deliver it to dear inspector killaine,3
i have my own warrant stop a minute please,3
i know killaine has a warrant,3
theyre going to arrest me,3
no percentage in that,3
i hated to go to that place i almost went to the police station instead,3
youre probably mistaken about that lets get together sand talk it over theres always a solution to these problems but it must be near the water quite near yes if you dont mind waiting,3
theres another manright outside the booth here i never saw him before,3
cant be too close for me right across the street from it suits me anything else listed,3
i dont think thats on the market anymore id like something much closer to the water,3
im in the hudson bay companys store that man last nightthe one that followed me,3
it sounds like a fair location could you be a little more exact,3
from you i like it,3
so have i,3
thats the second round ive lost tonight that fellow hurt me,3
no use waiting then,3
nothing matters,3
it still doesnt matter if i kiss you,3
try not talking,3
take me homeand forget you ever saw me thats a silly remark isnt it,3
anything i can do about it,3
no matter theres nothing i can do about it,3
why,3
all rightfollowing me,3
us,3
he was following usbut hes not a policeman,3
hes not a cop a cop wouldnt have kneed me,3
you dont know who he is,3
hes a fellow with a very hard knee and he knows how to use it,3
well find out,3
absolutely sure,3
quite sure you saw him in the hotel lobby,3
then hes,3
couldnt be,3
then hes got to be a detective,3
killaines not that sort of guy he said nohe meant no,3
we walked right passed him hes following us,3
i didnt notice him,3
that man over there he was in the hotel lobby,3
i know everybody i dont look at half of life just the nice half i look at all of it,3
they know you hereknow your name,3
why not,3
dance here,3
want to dance,3
at this time of night its not as bad as it looks,3
is this the best you can do,3
cold,3
im different i like it fine,3
you too my name is betty mayfield i was born and i am here message ends thats what i told him he didnt like it,3
just who are you anyway,3
certainly not to me,3
lets not pretend mitchell meant anything to either of us,3
dance tonight,3
so there is you dont want to go to bed i dont want to go to bed lets go somewhere and hear some musichave something to drink something to eateven dance,3
theres a lot of night left to live through,3
quarter after one why,3
what time is it,3
thats putting it mildly,3
he could hardly help suspecting you,3
bad enough,3
bad,3
you didnt have to tell him that,3
theres one thing i may as well tell you youll find it out anyhow i tried to run awaywhen i found him out there on the balcony there wasnt any plane,3
no thanks,3
want a spike in it,3
its always a mistake to run away always,3
there wasnt any plane,3
you tried to run away,3
id rather wait until it does matter,3
go aheadif you want to it doesnt matter,3
thats all there is,3
he was a great boy for that what else,3
he knew the immigration officer he eased himself in,3
nice of him,3
on a train he said he lived here and he offered to make a reservation for me,3
how did you meet him,3
i dont,3
theyll know whether he killed himself,3
sure but somebody always does,3
no and ive never fired a gun in my life arent you supposed not to touch it,3
not with my consent strange as it seems i dont know how he got in i dont know anything,3
he got in here how,3
there isnt one that anyone would believe i went for a walk after dinner down to the oceanalone i came up and went to bed i didnt sleep very well then there was a thunderstorm and it began to rain i went across to close the french door thats the first time i saw him out there,3
theres one less tonight,3
whats funny about that if you pick up people like larry mitchell other people are bound to get funny ideas about you the world is full of larry mitchells,3
you said it wasnt a tragedy,3
dont take it so big it isnt a tragedy,3
much too late,3
i know its a littler late for an apology,3
no thank you,3
dance,3
he doesnt even know half the people who come up to drink his liquor,3
youre sure mr brandon wont mind,3
thanks for the fresh air that felt good,3
do you think i dont,3
neatly saidbut to the wrong man the trouble with pretty girls is that they cant imagine anyone thinking of anything else but the fact they are pretty girls i get tired of it,3
i hate to be alone but ive heard all the approaches there are even yours,3
i dont know you and you dont know me i made a reasonably polite suggestion but im sure youd rather be alone,3
i didnt say anything,3
whatever you say,3
would it make you anymore amusing,3
i can be talked out of it as a matter of fact id like a dry martini myself,3
youre drinking it,3
no are you really going to drink that stuff,3
and do you amuse the guests,3
i never pay for anything they just keep me here to amuse the guests,3
youre not paying for this its quite enough that you let me sit at your table,3
sure but id hate like the dickens to be held to everything ive said before wouldnt you,3
as i said before,3
no not very well and i like his friends even less but if you really want a good dry martini,3
you dont sound as if you liked him very much,3
brandon clark brandon fellow about my age lot of money that he didnt make former american now naturalized in canada social standing indeterminate manners not quite perfect scotch superb,3
what did you say his name was,3
its openhouse no crashing involved anybody in the hotels welcome,3
i dont need it that badly i dont enjoy crashing other peoples parties,3
it might be worth a martini to you,3
i see,3
a fellow named brandon has a penthouse here hes holding open house i was up there too noisy bored,3
disgusting arent they if you really want a martini i know where you can get one,3
your liquor laws,3
i see,3
sit down then we often have a double up here,3
no please,3
you can have the table yourself if youd rather im only killing time,3
right miss,3
ale i dont mind,3
beer or ale miss,3
beer well all right,3
sorry miss beer and ale only canadian law,3
id like a dry martini very dry please,3
yes miss,3
i understand betty i understand perfectly,3
but i tell youif youd only understand,3
i hope he can prove it come on you dont want to get pneumonia,3
no jeff you dont hes not a murderer i tell you hes not a murderer,3
we know everything,3
he could have killed me a dozen times youd never have known,3
goodbye betty,3
not sometimes always just because it is the hard way youre that kind of man jeff,3
sometimes,3
you do things the hard way dont you,3
theres an empty taxi across the street if youre so anxious take it hell know the way to the police headquarters,3
but even if you were in love with me,3
i know that,3
what proper grounds you cant be in love with me you hardly know me im not in love with you,3
ive been a soldier too there is a difference a policeman like a judge has a right to disqualify himself on proper grounds,3
what are you going to dotoss your job into puget sound because i make you think of magnolias i thought policeman was something like a soldier that his duty came first however much he might happen hate it,3
youre still a police officer jeff i saw you send those two men away i know they were watching me,3
thats theyre business can i drop you somewhere,3
what will they do to you,3
i cant answer that,3
to do what,3
youve got a couple of hours maybe,3
im enough of a copper to do my duty my boss made it tough for me if i dont arrest you ive gone soft if i do its to save my face i dont play those rules,3
because you think your in love with me,3
thats something i cant spare you but i wont do it myself,3
theyll only find someone else who wont be so kind,3
times up im off the case,3
i always wear gloves when i shoot people a bad jokebut better than tears,3
so mitchell had handled it afterwards brandon picked it up theres no indication you handled it,3
looking for peanuts i suppose,3
not quiet yet we know who the gun belonged to margo west she told us this morning it doesnt mean much mitchell took it away from her he had a habit of going through her bag,3
jeff shall we go now jeff and get it over with,3
they call me jeff,3
what do your friends call you the ones that know you welland like you very much,3
thats my hard luckim man enough to tell you about itand not be sorry,3
very ridiculous,3
palm trees against a sunsetwaves breaking on a coral reefthe taj mahal by moonlightroses in an english garden just after a shower clich??s one and allbut good ones with a lot of mileage left in themtheres one thing he does not seemurderand murder was what he was sent to find pretty ridiculous isnt it,3
what does he see,3
he looks at the girl looks into her eyes,3
points very straight to her,3
im about to be very silly a man passes a girl on the streeta very lovely girlhis eyes meet her eyes and something reaches out and takes hold of his heart and then she goes on and is lost in the crowdand he says to himself there goes my lost love and its trueif he never sees her again its still true of course after a while he forgets or almost forgetsbecause after a while we forget almost everything but this man is a copper he gets ordersroutine ordersto go to a place and investigate a murder and everything points to a certain girl,3
there must be but when im with you i cant find it,3
you wouldnt even try there must be some copper in you or you wouldnt be an inspector,3
i might be able to save you if i knew enough,3
i expected nothing else,3
ive come here to arrest you for murder,3
i dont want to talk,3
this isnt a very good place to talk,3
there isnt anything you can do,3
then there isnt much i can do is there,3
you understand perfectly,3
if i understand what you meant by that,3
nobody can help me you least of all,3
you wont tell me who you are you wont even give me a chance to help you,3
youre a police officer a very nice onebut you have a job to do im a girl whos in a jam and its your job to keep me there dont go considerate on me i might start to bawl,3
we try to be decent,3
youor the vancouver police department,3
i wouldnt make you talk about it my job is the death of marry mitchell why cant you give me your confidence,3
youve has an experience that you dont want to talk about an unhappy marriage for example,3
the police always do dont they,3
ill find out you know perhaps not todayperhaps not tomorrow but in the end ill find out,3
id like to believe that its not too easy,3
you were there when i last saw him,3
were 98 per cent certain mitchell was murdered there are a lot of reasons was he very drunk when you last saw him,3
is it a crime,3
but not in the investigation of a major crime i hope,3
who hasntone way or another,3
youve had dealings with the police before,3
you were a galahad compared to some cops ive known,3
true i was a bit irritable last night i apologize,3
we wouldnt have met at all,3
down belows stanley park on the other side of the trees theres a beach you can see it stevestons over there coast guard station theres the yacht club and beyond it the docks the over on the other side of the inlet theres grouse mountain its about 4000 feet high theres a restaurant on top of it very nice restaurant im sorry we couldnt have met in pleasanter circumstances miss mayfield,3
ive never been to florida,3
florida,3
you must come from pretty far south,3
deep blue id call it greyblue,3
care for a stroll outside beautiful morning the air is like wine the sky is a deep blue,3
theyre all crude when they dont work had breakfast,3
good morning mr killaine im sorry i cant give you the name of my bankbecause i have no bank at the moment that was a crude trick,3
i probably shallafter ive tortured you a little more,3
why dont you arrest me and be done with it,3
an unhappy marriage hardly seems a sufficient reason for that,3
a graduation present,3
wheres you get it,3
yes,3
what this,3
would you be satisfied if i said i shot him,3
stop saying youre sorry i want information not regrets,3
im sorry,3
regimental seaforth highlanders,3
your family coat of arms mr killaine,3
theres the clear mark of a wedding ring on your finger,3
who told you i was married,3
well thats not getting us anywhere you wont tell me who you are or give any account of yourself you wont even give me your address in the united states why unhappy marriage,3
it is,3
thats an evasion and you know it,3
you didnt ask a question you made a speech,3
please answer my question,3
miss mayfield the humor of the situation escapes me within 24 hours i shall know officially whether mitchell was murdered privately im quite sure of it now it happened in your room and you came to vancouver with him at any rate he made your hotel reservation and you arrived together here in this room he behaved nastily to you and you said something to him which might be taken as a threat a few hours later he was found dead on your balcony would it be too much too suggest that all these circumstances taken together are a little suspicious,3
im sorry thats all there is,3
ill have to know a little more than that,3
i was born in new york city i grew up and here i am,3
you probably know the type you find them in hotels and resorts all over the world they always have clothes and money and usually have had three or four husbands they dress and enamel themselves with great care they worry a great deal about those little lines at the corner of the eyes and they demonstrate their incompetence at the art of living bet getting mixed up with people like larry mitchell tell me about yourself miss mayfield,3
i dont know her or particularly want to,3
mrs west is a very emotional woman,3
this way,3
mr reed please for mr brandon very well have him call mr brandon is in his office now mr reed stepped out mr brandon,3

you hurt my feelings i ought to raise the price to be a thousand,3
i dont know whether to knock your teeth down your throator call the policeor just give you twenty bucks to go out and buy yourself a clean nose,3
quit trying to scare me mr brandon im neurotic,3
thats a nice hard knee youve got goble howd you like to trade it for a broken neck,3
mayfield oh that girl you were with last night you havent hired me yet mr brandon,3
what have you got on miss mayfield,3
40 a day and expenses expenses run pretty high on a case like this im a long way from home i dont have a bc licence id need about 500 for a retainer,3
what are your rates,3
you guessed it the cards phony i got plenty of em different names different jobs i work out of san francisco go anywhere do anything all it takes is the folding,3

im not sure i want anything from you you might want something from me,3
im still asking what do you want,3

nice friendly approach youve got goble i could hardly walk when i got out of bed this morning,3
im not interested in blind dates,3
id like a few words with you in private,3
that comedian,3
until he comes hes a nice guy youve met him,3
im sorry this thing has just knocked me silly how long do we have to wait for this police character,3
they still hang women in canada ive heard,3
leave that one lay,3
and without much discrimination,3
sometimes,3
you make friends quickly dont you clark,3
you killaine,3
martini,3
whatll you have margo,3
fascinated,3
let me introduce you mr killaine mrs west,3
in the same elevator it is a public conveyance,3
hi margo hello killaine you two come together,3
i dont like to be tailed the lady im with doesnt like to be stared at to put the matter in a couple of nutshells i dont like you,3
whats this in favor of,3
the new ones are fine the last set i had gave me all kinds of trouble,3
how are your teeth getting along,3
ive got good ears,3
who told you my name,3
me a cop what made you think that mr brandon,3
so youre not a cop,3
whats a buzzer,3
all right lets see the buzzer,3
oh that was just one of those idle questions one doesnt expect an answer,3
you asked me where it all came from,3
what,3
i had a father who knew how to steal,3
where did it all come from or is that a permissible question,3
i buy my shirts by the dozen fortunately,3
i tried it once i lost my shirt,3
now and then mostly just for the fun of it,3
you do a lot of real estate trading brandon,3
wait a minute ill go with you,3
im afraid they do far too often so long,3
you forgetting the gag line killaine the police dont take anything for granted,3
where would she go anyway dont tell me you havent got her covered,3
no more for me thanks remember what i said i cant interfere with the law,3
no idea,3
you dont buy it okay so i still want betty mayfield where is she,3
romeo in reverse uhuh no sale killaine,3
or just drunk enough he was with her when she registered he knew where her room was you were out most of the evening there was a lot of mess to clean up waiters coming and going the door standing open suppose mitchell came in to grab a drink for himself then wandered out on this balcony then realized bettys balcony was just below yours,3
mitchell was too drunk,3
she didnt have to he could have climbed down from here,3
how could mitchell after that act he put on up here is it likely shed let him in,3
mitchell was killed down here how could clarendon get in to do it or margo for that matter,3
and old man clarendon he had a motive too margo and her money,3
your concentrating too hard killaine what about margo west she had a motive i guess you know by this time whose gun it was,3
not if she knew she wouldnt be believed,3
that could be told,3
it could have been an accident,3
dont kid me you dont think she murdered mitchell,3
information,3
you passed up a dozen chances to arrest her what toughened you up,3
the only answer i have for you,3
doesnt answer the question,3
youd be breaking the law,3
would that make me a heel,3
ive always thought you were a pretty nice guy brandon id like to go on thinking so if you tried to help her get away,3
that must hurt,3
i have a warrant for her arrest,3
a couple of hours,3
sure lets discuss betty mayfield how long since you saw her,3
could we discuss that some other time,3
money is a sort of sixth sense that gives meaning to all the others very appealing especially to a poor man,3
i wouldnt know,3
i would fancy waking up every morning with that in your lap wonderful thing money is remember what somerset maugham said about it,3
i never notice the view after the first week,3
thanks lovely view you have havent you,3
thanks i dont mind,3
if it doesnt take too long drink,3
time for a little chat,3
wellgood night,3
i dont,3
in case you want to have us followed,3
delightfully every time miss mayfield says something i know less than i did before well i may as well knock off for tonight good night miss mayfield do let me thank you for your cooperation,3
how are you two getting along,3
no thanks i had some how would you like to take a walk for say half and hour,3
how about a cup of coffee,3
we do when we get the chance,3
near his right hand about a foot away perhaps more good heavens one doesnt use a tape measure,3
it was lying where on the balcony,3
no,3
i rather thought so and before that had you ever seen the gun,3
could be,3
quite sure you had no motive,3
on miss mayfields balcony beside the chaise i picked it up dont ask me why i ought to know better,3
where,3
yes ive seen it before,3
thank you,3
thats what i thought at first maybe somebody else ought to have thrown this party with my liquor of course,3
she doesnt look like a girl who would let herself be picked up on a train,3
somebody mitchell picked up on the train i dont even know her name,3
hardly whos the girl,3
would it have helped if id knocked him down,3
if i can get off,3
round of golf saturday,3
the usual grind,3
hows life treating you,3
thats what i like about cocktail parties everyone is so perfectly natural,3
youre not english,3
it goes with this cold houses and warm drinksthe effete englishman,3
a private joke,3
what,3
dont bet on it im eccentric,3
you dont throw guests out brandon,3
want to walk out or get thrown out,3
how would you know brandon,3
i wouldnt know just do it somewhere else there is such a thing as good manners,3
did i do something wrong,3
do me a favor mitchell find yourself a nice secluded park bench,3
lay off what this is my new girl friend met her on the train shes very fond of me love at first sight wasnt it baby,3
lay off cant you,3
whats the matter baby dont you like me anymore,3
the liquors lovely the rest of the party you can have,3
hello mitchell having fun,3
nothing to discuss tomorrow the sun will shine even brighter be grateful for small mercies,3
i think wed better discuss this in my office mr mitchell,3
im afraid this is all for the moment,3
rather more than a little something mr mitchell,3
a little something on account perhaps,3
mr mitchell,3
good afternoon mr campbell,3
he was very easy to hate if youll look in your mirror when you are in a better temper youll know why,3
nastiness youre nasty with words why wouldnt you be nasty with deeds once in a while you hated himand i know why,3
with what motive,3
you could have got in that room just as you got in here how do i know you didnt kill larry,3
how clumsy id never forgive myself good night my dear,3
one of these days youre going to wake up in the middle of the night and find that youve cut your throat,3
convenient isnt it,3
theyll arrest that girl everything points to her,3
so he didbut he hasnt told you what he saw i have,3
he saw my face too,3
i saw your face this evening when the detective showed you the gun you lied it was obvious,3
thats not enough,3
im a very observant man you had something in your bag this afternoon something that causes you to hold it in a particular way something that made a particular sound when you put it down on the bar you went out with mitchell none of us ever saw him again,3
sardonic if you will my dear bust nasty you lied about the gun,3
you nasty sardonic,3
and now that hes safe from all other women you can go on loving him,3
dont be a fool i loved him he wasnt worth it but i loved him,3
orsince one is a wellknown and respected guestone could go to the desk in the lobby and say miss mayfield seems to have lost her room keyhave you another they always have another,3
passkey,3
see how easy it is perhaps miss mayfield left her door unlocked or if she didnt theres a passkey on every floor in the linen room the head porter has a passkey the bell captain has a passkey the hotels full of passkeys,3
what do you want,3
i dont think you locked your door,3
what are you doing here,3
oh shut up you havent even got your spats on,3
so much less refined than frizzling them in the chair,3
i see out friend larry mitchell is with us again,3
im getting positively haggard in a couple of years people will be describing me as well preserved,3
thank you it is rather late and im not young anymore good night,3
i neednt keep you any longer mr clarendon,3
thank you,3
no not recently im sure of that,3
recently then,3
im sorry inspector i dont know much about,3
mr clarendon have you ever seen this before,3
we dont need him,3
magruders conked out adrenaline injections oxygen tent he may come out of it and he may not as a source of quick information we cant forget him,3
whats the face for driscoll,3
men like you dont need orders,3
thanks inspector what are your orders about this wire to san francisco,3
the supers just given me the sweetest dressing down ive ever had im still reeling from it and believe me i had it coming i apologize what you think is importanti think is important,3
how important would it have to be its only murder inspector,3
catch me at the vancouver royal if its important,3
if youre asking my opinion no id read it to greer over the phone ask him if he had any objections,3
would you,3
send that,3
id suggest a telegram something like this chief of police san francisco a licensed private detective named named martin j goble address soandso has been found murdered within our jurisdiction his partner name somethingsomething greer refuses to give us any information correction refuses information necessary to our investigation can you assist signed detective sergeant driscoll vancouver british columbia police,3
i got through to greer his partner in the detective business greer wont give out,3
i understand pity to mess up a nice clean boat,3
if youd seen the blood on his headand some body had to carry him out to sea,3
swimming with his hat on thats original,3
weve done that hes a san francisco private eye name martin j goble goble had initials in his hat and for once he lived where he bought it goble and greer is the firm name,3
you told me when wed identified this fellow,3
ive got a year or a second im not sure which,3
got a moment inspector,3
im an irishman sir an irishman is always logical,3
and dont get too logical driscoll in police business it doesnt work i wish it did but it doesnt,3
let me know when youve identified him,3
ive been on the waterfront detail for twelve years this man hadnt been dead an hour he wasnt killed last night he was killed today in broad daylight thats no drunk rolling job,3
drunkrolling job they hit him too hard,3
you have two murders to investigate this mans head was beaten in and theres nothing in his pockets,3
youre the waterfront specialist find out about it ive got a murder to investigate,3
not a floater only just dead,3
floater,3
the harbor police have just picked up a dead man out of the water,3
when you sign for it you count it its your dough,3
open it and count it,3
i need a receipt sign your name across the flap,3
sounds like a fair swap lets take a look,3
you get its brother,3
what do i get for it,3
one of those nice long manila envelopessealed not too fat not too thin,3
mr brandon couldnt be here he might have left something for you what would it look like,3
talk english how do i know youre you,3
itll be a tough dollar when guys like you learn the alphabet,3
go live in a tent,3
i have an appointment with him right here right now,3
the joints not open mac whos brandon,3
im looking for mr brandon,3
a think wirebut very very strong lets get out of here,3
greer and goble in the call building san francisco just like you thoughttwo murders in two days different places different methods different people nothing connects them but a telephone number,3
and a motivewhich we havent got so this could all be a dream,3
you win inspector you win all along the line why didnt we think of brandon beforeor did we some of us yeah of course you did when a suspect thinks hes safe you go on letting him think hes safe wait for a mistake,3
did we ever really think it was suicide,3
no suicide,3
if she didntif luck was against himhe wipes the gun off reaches the wall up theredrops it on the chaise,3
and she did give him the chance the way it worked out,3
he could have tried if he was up there in the dark listening hed know when she came home know when she found mitchell dead know what she did about it if she telephoned hed probably hear that,3
how did he know hed get the chance he couldnt have arranged it,3
ive got to find a way to handle it openly like brandon,3
so,3
ive handled it mitchells handed it if i wipe it off no suicide if i take it out and lose it no suicide if i leave it hereno suicide,3
well what about it,3
this is the shell what about the gun,3
youve got a dead man on your hands like this,3
pretty big chance huh,3
you can find out the first part the second part you have to take a chance on,3
do i know that shes out of the room likely to be out of it for some time,3
you can find out,3
do i know who lives down there,3
assume there is something to hid i go to a lot of trouble what do i do what would you do,3
such as,3
exactly now im the killer and theres something i dont want you to know something that would destroy my comfortable life rob me of my friends my position,3
before i took the story and closed the case id want to know a lot more about these people id want to know just about everything about them,3
theyll probably believe you but theyll want to know what you were fighting about why mitchell had a gun youll tell them a simple story theyll pretend it sounds all right to them now youre headquarters how does it sound to you,3
if ive got any sense im going to call headquarters,3
youve got a dead man on your hands you killed jimeven if it wasnt murder what are you going to do about it,3
should be over there,3
wheres the shell,3
i think so,3
was that about the right angle,3
there wasnt any motivelets try out the act,3
maybe weve been pretty dumb,3
not too hard is it,3
somebody did it twice last night in the dark,3
thats pretty risky business inspector,3
market it seems to me thats a san francisco exchange,3
gigi huh sounds frenchone of those fancy ladies must have been very fancy if he scratched her phone number in gold,3
gg market oneeightfourtwo,3
i guess im just ballast around here,3
ill know when i find it,3
she didnt seem the type to lam outeven if she got the chance that stuff was all gone through last night anything special youre looking for inspector,3
ive always looked forward to it all right lets get him out of here and tidy up,3
right a clean deduction from observed facts theyve got to be simple once in a while inspector,3
so the wound and the shell give you the same answer,3
unless the gun was slanted up,3
so the shell ought to have gone over,3
this make of gun throws a shell backwards high and to the right the chaise is only about four feet from the wall,3
correct inspector a womans gun us 125 caliber ammunition in it it was on a table in there,3
pearlhandled 25 automatic uh no its a belgian gun 66 mm,3
its her room she only got to the hotel this afternoon with him i guess he took too much for granted heres the gun,3
ive met her,3
i supposed you knew her too inspector,3
they tell me hell be a great loss to the liquor trade this mayfield girl,3
i knew him he was easy to dislike poor chap,3
i hate to pull rank on you sergeant but once in a whilefor moral purposesyou might address me as inspector in moments of extreme desperation you might even call me sir,3
right,3
so it seems sergeant,3
you in charge here,3
you would still have planted information that clarendon knew about the gunand not as an accusation but in the process of defending yourself by making a confession very neat good morning mrs west,3
and if you didnt believe me,3
sure you didnt come here in person just to tell me about the gun you wanted me to be looking across the desk at you while you talked about mitchell if i believe you it would be psychologically impossible for you to have killed him last night,3
now youre being beastly,3
perhaps a rich widow would have solved all his problems,3
i dont understand,3
ill investigate mr clarendons financial position,3
it does may i go now,3
not if it clears the air,3
at first it doesnt hurt at all thats shock then it hurts terriblyyou wouldnt believe such pain could existand six months later you cant remember what pain felt like it hasnt taken six months this time it hasnt even taken twenty four hours is that a beastly thing to say,3
mortar shells are not funny either,3
did you ever have a serious operation,3
you didnt play it for laughs last night,3
yesand hes already becoming vague to me funny last night i was furiously jealous jealous of what i out that gun in my bag deliberately who was i going to kill with it a girl i didnt even know a man i knew to be a thief and a forger a halfman a gigolo its already ludicrous love what a comedy,3
that depends upon your motive you were in love with mitchell werent you,3
i am a fool,3
of course not thanks for telling me i havent seen mr clarendon,3
you couldnt possible have traced it this soonnot possibly,3
it was clarendon he knew i had the gun in my bag,3
other people always know so much more than we knowso much more than theyre willing to tell us,3
how did you know clarendon you cops never tell anybody anything do you,3
remember that time didnt i good morning mrs west does your visit here mean youve changed your mind,3
thank you very much mrs west,3
id be delighted to anytime you can show me the doubt ill wrap it up in tissue paper and put a christmas seals on it for her,3
then why not give miss mayfield the benefit of the doubt,3
anybody could commit suicide if he felt low enough ive felt it myself,3
i shall from your knowledge of mitchell would you say he would be likely to commit suicide,3
i was in love with him which shows you the quality of my brains why dont you ask her about the gun,3
you knew mitchell pretty well didnt you mrs west,3
not quiet yet,3
what about me,3
positive,3
i never saw it before,3
warm water no doubt,3
scotch and plain water i think,3
are you always this witty,3
oh nothing,3
may you what,3

and in the meantime this girl goes where she pleases does what she pleases,3
we lifted seven fairly good prints from miss mayfields toilet articles washington ought to teletype us within a few hours,3

well find out whos covering her,3
i dont know sir,3

a little of both sir and perhaps not quiet enough of either,3
are you a policeman or a softheaded nincompoop,3
when i give an order youll not need it interpreted you have an hour to make your mind up well are ye satisfied mr mitchell,3
am i to interpret that as an order to arrest miss mayfield,3
aye you have a point there,3
which forces me to arrest her against my better judgment,3
i hear shes a very pretty girl,3
no,3
shes the only one who had a dead man in her room the only one who wont give an account of herself the only one who tried to run away and the only one so far ive been told who went to such lengths to disguise her identity that she even removed the labels from her clothes what more do you want,3
shes a suspect naturally but not the only one,3
ive explained the situation to mr mitchell up to a point now about this mayfield girl,3
how do you do sir,3
killaine this is mr mitchell senior young mitchells father he just flew in from toronto,3
unsophisticated if i knew about this babe,3
youre very attractive my dear and you look very unsophisticated,3
i say yes,3
she is beautiful and young no thank you,3
in that case theres someone here id like to introduce to you over there,3
i have no intension of being nasty mr mitchell,3
be nasty,3
its quite unimportant mr mitchell after all you got what you wanted,3
im sorry i forgot about calling for you,3
in an hour larry,3
right,3
a girl you meet on the train excuse my bringing it up again be back in an hour right,3
i told you shes just,3
how about your new friend,3
of course,3
oh forget it clark brandons throwing a party up in his penthouse this evening take me,3
i didnt mean it that way im sorry,3
you already have the checks darling,3
its against the law to cross the border with a gun the canadian police might like to know about this,3
years why,3
how long have you had it,3
what does it look like,3
whats this,3
kind or not kind whats the difference it always ends up the same way,3
thats not very kind,3
i seem to remember that you like to help yourself,3
i seem to recognize this routine first the kiss then the touch oh whats the use youre you,3
its the only pose i have left im sunk broke i dont even have my hotel bill,3
you dont have to make a pose of it,3
ive always been a heel i guess i always will be,3
she is much younger than i am thats something im going to have to get used to isnt it larry theyll all be much younger than i am here tear them up,3
whatll we do about it margo,3
correct i couldnt even afford to pay a lawyer to defend me,3
youd go to jail for a long term,3
i have a rough idea,3
you know what would happen to you if i turned these over to the police,3
i hoped to get enough to cover them before they cleared i wasnt lucky,3
splendid now she can return the compliment,3
i dont my hunch is shes just torn up an unhappy marriage i was able to do her a small favor,3
you ought to know why,3
rich i havent the faintest idea why,3
shes very beautiful shes much younger than i am and shes rich i hope,3
margo darling you washed me up remember were just friends you wanted it that way,3
as thoroughly as i could it wasnt easy but you are helping me,3
you shouldnt you washed me up very thoroughly,3
why should i mind,3
shes just a girl i met on the train you dont mind do you,3
nice,3
her names mayfield betty mayfield,3
whos the girl,3
soso,3
with your charm how could i help it have a nice trip,3
im afraid youre not very glad to see me margo,3
oh many things inertia stalin and the cold war a failure of nerve we took the seediest most inefficient fifth of the economy into state care paid out millions for it put the same old duffers in charge a new broom with very old bristles when the tories were returned i went and sat in the bm and wrote my little book on chartism,3
what went wrong,3
did he i left school and worked for the labour party my older brother george had just been killed in greece and hed been an active member i heroworshipped him he was 25 years old it was an exciting time for us those first couple of years after the war we thought the country was about to become a true democracy i can understand why people of your generation want to write about that time they feel betrayed they want to know what went wrong,3
didnt evelyn waugh say that the country under atlee seemed to be under enemy occupation,3
then i began to listen to what the welloff were saying about the poor now ?€? the war had just ended and the language was much the same as it had been before the first reform act a small minority thought that england was really theirs they had made it they owned it the rest the wage earners were foreigners outsiders intent on wrecking it all,3
yes,3
shall we go,3
well we were just,3
hello anyone for a walk tom isnt i can tell you,3
these are transcripts of various radio broadcasts including gaitskills the one they tried to stop you ought to have that,3
i will thanks,3
the references are to hansard or to newspapers i havent got the actual speeches now youll have to chase them up,3
well see you next week and if,3
thank you,3
dont be silly ill look out some more suez material for you youll be very welcome,3
well id hate to be a nuisance,3
shell be here next weekend why dont you come too james ill show you the marshes properly if youre lucky you might even see the first of the geese arriving from siberia,3
yes,3
its a pity she couldnt make it up here today,3
actually weve only just met but were quiet good friends,3
i do worry about susan have you known her long she hasnt mentioned you,3
i think youll do very well,3
youre kind to be so encouraging,3
if you like but dont be too modest james the citizens duty is to remember not necessarily to write books you are highly qualified youre a responsible journalist doing what sounds to me like a very demanding job every day you take decisions that depend on your sense of history a genuine tyranny would have to get rid of people like you,3
so i can go ahead and be a historian without feeling like a poseuri shall be fulfilling a citizens duty,3
thanks,3
here i am lecturing you have some p??t??,3
if we leave the remembering to historians then the struggle is already lost everyone must have a memory everyone needs to be a historian in this country for example were in danger of losing hardwon freedoms by dozing off in a perpetual present,3
history books are first onto the bonfires,3
to james i remember what it was i was going to say we were talking about forgetfulness the czech writer kundera has one of his characters say that the struggle of man against tyranny is the struggle of memory against forgetting,3
to ann,3
and id like you to call me ann,3
please do i was beginning to wonder who this mr penfield was,3
since you are a friend of my daughters i think im entitled to call you james dont you think,3
its fine thank you,3
my husband apologises for not joining us its not too cold for you mr penfield,3
good suez was a minefield for both parties,3
yes,3
i see are you a socialist mr penfield,3
well i am a great admirer of your work i read your books on chartism when i was still at school im a journalist not a historian there are questions of method and approach i wondered,3
it wasnt much more than a pot boilersuez was very important for our generation i didnt want it to be forgotten and thats why id like to be able to help you but really mr penfield i looked through my notes before you came theyre all very much out of date theres been so much published since i dont think im your man,3
what a shame,3
my first husband worked for the bbc i doubt if anyone there remembers him now just another long dead diligent administrator he would have been useful in the fight to preserve the bbcs independence during the suez crisis one of the few things he was passionate about i became involved too i started work on a book that would have been published on the tenth anniversary of suez then he died and i loots the will to write it by the time i was over his death other books had been published and it wasnt worth going on,3
he was delightful,3
hes a little unhappy i hope he wasnt a nuisance,3
tom daddy would like to see you in the garden and will you ask betty to bring us some coffee and remember to say please,3
its kind of you to see me,3
mr penfield i am sorry to have kept you,3
ill suggest it remember though were news not features it might help if you could get yourselves attacked by the police anyway ill be back with this soon thanks,3
but what we need is national coverage its difficult with this falklands madness going on do you think you might be able to do something when you get back,3
terrific,3
very good,3
give them here this tells you how the womens peace camp came to be set up all local women at first then we had support from women and men all over the country,3
that doesnt matter as long as we can get our message through to someone there jill where are those handouts,3
but im not an interviewer or a correspondent,3

thank you,3
james i cant begin to tell you how pleased we all are congratulations and i really mean it,3
like i was saying the american angle in suez is very important i wouldnt want to say they let us down i think thats wrong a good ally is one who doesnt back you up in your mistakes who tells you when to pull back and the americans were good allies simple as that,3
you know the lingo jolly good so your language will have to be simple not stupid mind but simple very very simple and always remember its an american readership,3
freshman and sophomores,3
personally james im very excited by this new arrangement we have it gives us direct access to literally hundreds of american collages twentieth century history is a growth area over there dont ask me why your readership will be first and second year american collage students,3
thank you,3
and youll join me in a sambucca,3
yes please,3
are you going to have coffee,3
id want to set out events as they happened the way i see it is this the british empire was an ideal it may have become totally obsolete by the middle of this century but it wasnt totally dishonourable to try and defend its remains and try and salvage some selfrespect which is what i think the conservatives were trying to do then theres the essential,3
good,3
no id want to,3
yesyoure not a socialist then,3
from all the moralising and talk of national humiliation that is now the standard line on suez,3
and some of that sorry,3
break away completely from,3
ill have some of that,3
no thanks id like to break away,3
would you like a dessertim having one,3
i wont introduce you all by name basically james this is our uk sales team what was i saying yes these graduate trainees,3
hello,3
i know i know gentlemen let me introduce you to one of our most talented contributors to the cold war james penfield he wrote the opening chapter on the berlin airlift one of the best chapters in the book,3
i know im sorry,3
we dont seem to get much time to talk,3
oh excuse me theres nicholas,3
shall we have a drink or something,3
why not,3
in your car,3
thatll be fun,3
hes making plans for brighton he thought we could travel down together,3
what did he want,3
jeremy phoned this morning,3
yes might remember youre here to talk to my mother,3
might,3
might,3
i might,3
look will you come on a walk with me tomorrow,3
hes all right the professor,3
no its a bit of a madhouse for some reason a lot of my mothers friends specialise in monologues,3
i havent seen much of you,3
well you should,3
i havent really thought about it,3
do you think shes invited you up for her sake or for mine,3
no we talked about history and siberian geese,3
did she talk about me,3
i think she liked me,3
i think were ready now thank you and how was norfolk did you get on with my mother,3
you just might,3
i might see you in norfolk over the weekend,3
i bet thanks for the drink,3
in radio were different,3
i dont trust anyone thats what comes of working in television,3
you dont trust me,3
too late just my luck,3
two or three years ago i would have stayed and fucked you,3
me too,3
i have to be up early,3
why not stay,3
yes if you like call me at work,3
again,3
well you know,3
very thoughtful,3
i called you a taxi,3
who,3
damn theyre early,3
that must be rather nice in a way i mean you dont have any,3
both dead,3
it makes me weepy just to remember it so we were fine again and then she got married to matthew whos a womaniser and a bit of a yob but quite nice really makes tv commercials what about yours,3
how nice,3
mummy and i we were more like lovers really or sisters then a couple of years after daddy died and not long after i left oxford she started seeing various men and i was furious i really was upset i stopped going home i never phoned i went round telling everyone how awful her books were and she hardly seemed to notice and that made me angrier then i got a job i was interested in and i started to see lots of men and i suppose i grew up a little and began to understand so i wrote her a long letter almost seven pages saying how sorry i was and how i was worried that we were drifting apart and do you know she wrote me a poem a really beautiful poem about mothers and daughters,3
yes youre much too old to making a drama out of alienation or whatever you call it youve got to take responsibility for your own happiness thats what i think anyway,3
oh yes,3
i think youre exaggerating and if you arent you should jolly well change your job,3
no theres a fourth numbness you do everything right but you feel nothing either way,3
and youre at this third stage,3
everyone describes the same process at first it is exciting youre at the centre of the world as soon as anything happens youre the first to know about it and there are deadlines a dozen times a day even more and thats intimidating and exciting then you get the hang of it and the excitement wears off your a clerk in a rather dowdy office theres none of the glamour of television or the penetration of serious journalism youre a processor of semiofficial news some people leave at this stage then if you hang on and especially if youre promoted you discover a new kind of pleasure youre pleased by the ease with which you can write summaries and bulletins from news agency printouts by the way you ca judge length ending a broadcast on the dot having everything run smoothly selecting a running order that makes sense knowing instinctively what you can and cannot do professionalism,3
my real father well he was a flashback,3
too bad what did your father do,3
good theory but i like my mother i have no aversions to what she does,3
you dont like flashbacks because your mothers a historian,3
really i thought those long flashbacks were extremely good,3
and the shape of it all it was sort ofshapeless,3
oh but he was terrific,3
and i didnt like that man,3
i couldnt bear for it to end,3
i think it went on rather too long,3
i thought it was tremendous,3
i quite liked it i wasnt as enthusiastic as everyone else,3
what did you think of that wadja film,3
no its all right i can get a cab night night,3
can i give you a lift,3
yes thats right im being terribly rude bob oh bob this is bob tuckett bon was at oxford too,3
thank you we met last week at the wajda film you wont remember we didnt actually speak,3
was that your chapter then it was very good,3
thats her,3
so its all worked out perfectly,3
ive known susan for more than fifteen years james were old allies,3
youre a piece of shit,3
it might have worked really i would have been delighted for you if it had but she wasnt interested not my fault,3
my god you even cooked up that norfolk trip,3
and you were obviously getting nowhere with her i was waiting for the right moment to tell you that,3
fuck off,3
susan and i are very old friends james,3
are you up to something,3
big mistake i think you might have learned a lot,3
yes finally,3
six onion bajees great girl did you shake the mother off,3
im not sure,3
still in love,3
ill ring you,3
im off lets meet you promised to tell me about norfolk,3
perhaps i will then,3
will it be fun,3
delivering gossip and goodwill it seems well both be doing brighton perhaps you should come too,3
sorry got held up what are you doing here,3
fortunate that i was here to keep susan entertained,3
tame those rightsyou know were even freighting in a couple of exiled argie trade unionists from paris for a tv tie in one of them had his balls tapdanced on by the secret police the other one had to be hosed off the wall of his cell after the police yes my good man,3
hold those rights,3
on the torture of very small children but dont start telling them about their rights,3
the torture of small children,3
well everyones desperate for a new falklands angle purdys come up with a real dog workers rights in argentina so ive been running round getting people to do things but no ones keen workers rights when did anyone on that paper give a damn about workers rights i said to purdy look tits bingo jingo horoscope sport celebs gossip and the occasional firm stand on,3
what have you been up to,3
far too long,3
weve been playing ten minutes for christ sake,3
thats enough of that,3
no need to thank me if you dont want to just pay for these drinks,3
youve really got it all worked out havent you,3
according to this the daughter goes up to stay quiet often youll need to get yourself invited for the right weekend,3
ha ha,3
shes very nice apparently lives in norfolk and very leftwing youll have to watch yourself there,3
youre so gross,3
its obvious what you have to do your way into the daughters pants is through the mother up the suez canal,3
mmm,3
shes never written a book in it but she clearly knew a lot,3
ah ah theres more the piece celebrates the undying affection between eminent leftwing historian and he dazzling daughter then the news editor who happened to be in the room said that years ago when he worked on the guardian anne barrington had written a very good piece onguesssuez it was 1966 the tenth anniversary,3
let me see,3
an innocent interest and found out that last year vogue ran a series called mothers and daughters number seven anne and susan barrington being a decent loving friend i went to the files and made a copy for you,3
oh yes,3
youre so hard all right then i was chatting to some people from the diary page and the name of barrington came up i expressed an interest,3
jeremy just let me see what youve got,3
get way youll see when im ready first i want you to reflect on my noble behaviour on how your interests are closest to my heart how i lay awake at night worrying,3
let me see,3

now listen,3
you werent really interested in suez at all incredibly enough you were interested in my wife,3
she said that,3
susan told me that your visits to norfolk had well an ulterior motive,3
in fact its the invention of an advertising campaign they ran in the early sixties to encourage people to eat in pubs a completely successful fabrication of the past the ploughmans lunch was,3
uhuh,3
ploughmans lunch traditional english fare,3
i dunno ploughmans lunch,3
what would you call it,3
yes,3
ill tell you another thing we might have led the world once into the industrial revolution now we lead with television commercials were the best its as simple as that even the americans will admit it now the camera work the acting the scripts special effects weve got the lot nearly all the good directors here have ambitions to make serious films that food youre eating,3
well its worth seeing,3
no,3
i just might give you a ring when we get back to london theres one or two things id like to will you let me have your number before you leave have you ever watched a commercial being made,3
no he wasnt he just lowered himself into a bar stool and said oo i do feel bad i ad three pints of lager and six onion bajees,3
then one of them was sick all over your new dress,3
its true i was here last year doing a piece remember i was in the bar with all these northern trade unionists and their sponsored mps they were all incredibly fat and beery huge trousers and braces and so sweet they all stood round me like children saying you working for television youre just a young thing they wouldnt let me buy drinks even when i told them the programme was paying they kept looking at my pass which was pinned here and saying oo can i,3
its because he desires you the women get all the breaks at these conferences,3
it was incredible he came back made a pompous little bow and said my dear girl you may film me all afternoon if you wish and hes promised not to talk to the press,3
promise,3

guys the toxic avenger,3
angelo pay attention theres gonna be a test afterward lab is showing traces of toxins pcbs heavy elements selenium titanium and arsenic,3
johnny all i can say is we better come up with something real soon,3

i think you gotta hit them straight on,3
its all balance right and coordination how hard can it be,3
angelo this stuff is for little rubber people who dont shave yet,3
theyre like some kind of tribe got their own language you cant just walk up to these guys youve got to get out there learn some moves get into their head pick up the speech,3

bunch of goddamn adrenaline junkies i hope youre not buying into this banzaibullshit like the rest of bodhis moonies,3
yeah he thinks hes evolved to a higher plane of existence or something maybe he has youve seen him surf that frenzy it seems like anger its not its the energy of lovemaking the sea is the woman in his life shes his only true lover,3
sure hes the bodhisattva,3
we went out for about five minutes which is four minutes longer than most of them but you cant hold it against him hes different,3
meaning you were expendable,3
people are expendable to bodhi,3
oh oh that sounds personal,3
catch of the day,3
whos the girl,3
he rents it for the summer bodhi always gets some slick place and throws it open to every surf burnout around most a these guys cant keep a job when the swell comes theyre gone they have to ride,3

wait so im a big hero to my folks right but two years ago they got killed in a car wreck and i just suddenly realized all my goals had been their goals and i hadnt been living my own life so i wanted something for myself something that maybe didnt make any sense you know what i mean,3

strange major there was a firefight shooting in all directions,3
six others us issue jungle boots they came in from the north then followed the guerrillas,3
what do you mean,3
major looks like there were ten maybe twelve guerrillas looks like they took some prisoners from the chopper then a different set of track over there,3

whos our backup on this,3
our rendezvous points and radio freqs are indicated and fixed awacs contact on four hour intervals,3
go on,3
those cabinet members are very important to our scope of operations in this part of the world theyre about to get squeezed we cant let that happen i needed someone who could get the job done quick and quiet no screwups i needed the best the best so i pulled a few strings at the state department and here we are,3
wasnt my style were a rescue unit not assassins this must be good big shot from the cia leaves his desk to come back to the bush whats so important,3
also heard that you passed on that little job in libya,3
like the old days dillon,3
that piece of work you guys pulled off at the berlin embassy last week was really something blew the entry points on three floors and neutralized the opposition in eight seconds flat beautiful,3
you never did know when to quit,3
no way old buddy,3
youve been pushing too many pencils dillon had enough,3
we both got scores to settle,3

any sign of the hostages,3
someone else will be going in with you,3
whats that general,3
you lift off in three hours theres one other thing,3
we figure weve got less than twentyfour hours to catch up with them after that theres not much hope we want a rescue operation mounted tonight that doesnt give you much time,3
what have you got in mind general,3
thats the problem apparently they strayed off course were certain theyve been captured by the guerrillas,3
thats over the border general,3
its been a long time general,3
youre looking well dutch,3
why didnt he try to kill one of us last night,3
he knows our defenses,3
how could anyone get through this carry blain out right under our noses without leavin a trace,3

youre not getting any navy contracts,3

storage i think,3
whats that long building over there,3
youre very right i think the best thing we could all do is go home,3
youd be initiating a financial battle youd ultimately lose mr harris,3
this time i imagine you would yes hmm with all this in mind mr kross i cant logically make a formal bid on your company can i,3
quiet would i get the loans,3
i suppose youd find out soon enough that you have assets you presently dont seem aware of wouldnt you the waste processing licenses at that abandoned shipyard of yours youd certainly find out about that,3
i i dont know there there wasnt time,3
how,3
i i would take advantage of it,3
if you had a reprieve what would do,3
yes,3
stop for just a moment mr kross id like to ask you a few questions ubeforeu you sign you realize that youre a target if you werent mine youd be someone elses correct,3
youre making the right decision sir,3

how are you mr kross,3
mr harris,3
it is unotu your company its a public company and i uamu going to acquire it either i buy from the other stock holders or i buy from you,3
i dont question the legality of what you do its your morality that makes me sick i will not allow my company to be raped by a man like you,3
what i did with those companies was perfectly legal,3
i know all about you mr harris when you buy companies they have a way of disappearing even the pension funds are stripped clean the last three companies you took over were cut up in so many pieces widows were left without their retirement checks,3
no what i have is a lot of money,3
youve got a lot of nerve,3
mr kross im not here to sell you my stock on the contrary im here to buy yours,3
to get me in a mood to sell double what i paid but your company doesnt have enough capital right now to buy anything,3
