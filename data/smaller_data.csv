are you crazy take the boat,3
thats one way of putting it kitz the president the isc have shut down all official communications thereve also been reports of riots flaring up across the us and europe until we figure out what went wrong things may get rough especially for you,3
peter what is going on has everyone gone completely insane,3
how long was i gone,3
what day,3
peter what are you talking about what malfunction what day is this,3
its all right the important thing is youre safe,3
wait hold on a minute,3
thank god when we lost contact i thought we thought but youre okay were still trying to determine the nature of the malfunction did you notice anything at all that,3
im im fine,3
ellie are you okay,3
like it almost there,3
like it or not,3
that you valerian,3
its really happening,3
someone tell me this is really happening,3
you too,3
its good to see you ellie,3
peter,3
ellie,3
that is true but its also true that if i really thought we wanted the same things id follow you anywhere but the truth is i dont think you want the company be honest el theres nowhere youd rather be than sitting out at some remote corner of the world searching for the answers to the mysteries of the universe and call me crazy but i just cant compete with that im sorry,3
you sonofabitch,3
ellie im getting married her names laura she came up to owens valley to do her postdoc about six months after you left,3
im serious about this peter,3
ellie,3
right now well drive down to ramey and get the base chaplain to marry us,3
jesus,3
and you think i dont want those things you think i dont stay up half the night wondering if ive made the right choice living half a world away from you wondering if any of this is worth what im giving up for it everyday lets get married,3
maybe thats the problem i want a family ellie i want kids a townhouse on l street instead of still living like a college kid a real life maybe that makes me a sellout but i dont care anymore its what i want,3
please youre just as ambitious as i am more,3
the work jesus ellie cant there just once be more to life than the work okay maybe thats the only way to get the recognition win the prizes,3
but the work,3
this is a chance to be of enormous help to other peoples research to have the power to be a real advocate where davids got blind spots,3
but what about your research,3
im going on staff at the nsf to work for drumlin,3
greenbank,3
im moving to washington,3
we could be together again,3
actually,3
peter if you can get him to do that for me hed obviously do the same for you we could,3
thirtyone linked dishes you could search more sky there in a day than you could in a year here,3
the vla,3
what if i said i could get drumlin to agree to sell you time in new mexico,3
its almost there the hardest part is getting someone to sell us the telescope time,3
how close are you to getting this funding put together,3
if we lived at any previous time in human history we wouldnt even have the option of failing wed have to wonder our whole lives unable to do anything about it this time right now is unique in our history in any civilizations history the moment of the acquisition of technology the moment when contact becomes possible weve already beaten incredible odds by being lucky enough to be alive now,3
ellie even if you do manage to raise the money have you thought about what it would really mean to follow through on this i mean a college fetish is one thing but were talking about your career you wont be publishing you wont be taken seriously and you could spend your entire life looking and never find anything at all,3
weve been going after some of the big multinationals but without much luck got a donation from a new york dowager weve even been thinking about selling tshirts,3
ive examined over forty stars of roughly solar spectral type but so far nothing still weve barely started,3
and,3
please any chance of that died the day david drumlin was appointed head of the nsf i have been in contact with a few other seti people weve been trying to find backing from private investors ive even managed to scrounge a couple of hours of telescope time here and there,3
any luck on the grant money,3
i keep telling myself okay thats just the price you have to do your time doing shitwork before youre allowed to get to the good stuff but if i have to catalog one more quasar god ive missed you,3
is indistinguishable from magic,3
any sufficiently advanced technology,3
its like the precopernicans who swore the sun revolved around the earth or the victorians at the end of the last century who concluded that all major discoveries had now been made i mean try to imagine civilization a thousand years ahead of us then imagine trying to explain i dunno a microwave oven to someone even a hundred years ago i mean the basic concepts didnt exist,3
they cant i think its against human nature to admit to that level of insignificance to not see yourself as basically the center of the universe,3
im just so sick of feeling defensive about the things i care about or being lumped in with the lunatic fringe by people like drumlin when if theyd just put aside their preconceptions for two seconds and look at the facts,3
what a coincidence it happens to be my fetish too,3
keep it down okay drumlin thinks im enough of a flake as it is look everyone here has their little fetishes caven goes to topless bars vernons got his carnivorous plants mine just happens to be extraterrestrial intelligence,3
i read your paper on etis its brilliant,3
yavol,3
sounds like a russian general,3
peter valerian,3
ellie arroway,3
thats what they all say,3
hes an incredible prick but i never learned so much in my life,3
its beautiful but it does get a little lonely sometimes i think the reason we build these things in such godforsaken places isnt to avoid excess radio traffic but because were all such pathetic antisocial misfits speaking of which howre you getting on with the old man,3
drumlin said youre been down at arecibo for the last year,3
something my dad they said after all the suffering after all the desolation of the void the one thing that makes the vastness tolerable is each other the one thing that makes it bearable is love,3
meaning,3
im not sure maybe it simply exists in the search for it maybe its something we have to make for ourselves,3
does that mean you think it doesnt exist,3
i dont know if it was a god it was searching for a greater one it was still searching for meaning,3
in other words,3
in other words god works in mysterious ways,3
maybe what you experienced cant be reduced to images on a videotape maybe they still plan to grant your request only in their own way in their own time or maybe its just like you said ultimately their motives may be as incomprehensible as their technology,3
but it is a good question and i suppose ill always wonder about the answer why would they send me back without proof,3
ellie if you go out there like this if you admit to even the possibility that what you experienced didnt actually happen im afraid they really will crucify you please for your own sake for the sake of the world tell them what you know to be the truth tell them it really happened,3
i want to palmer more than anything but it has to be real it has to be true,3
have you seen whats happening out there the terror the despair the world is on fire ellie people need something they can believe in something worthy and you can give it to them,3
but,3
ellie the only one holding you to that standard is you the people want to hear your story they need to hear it,3
its not enough dont you understand i know it happened but by every standard of science by every standard ive lived my life by that fact is utterly beside the point it may be true but it doesnt matter because i cant prove its real,3
ellie youre the proof you tell them your story ultimately theyll have no choice but to believe you,3
i dont have any proof palmer,3
it also makes god enormous i think of the scope of your universe ellie and it takes my breath away as it will everyone elses,3
youre sure you want to in the universe i saw were not exactly the stars of the show what happened to me makes us all seem pretty damn small,3
i do,3
they dont believe me,3
im not sure its come to that,3
so im assuming they sent you here to administer last rites,3
pretty ironic huh i had to go all the way to the center of the galaxy just to find you,3
it was quite a page turner,3
im assuming you read my deposition,3
hi,3
hi,3
and yet thats always how i seem to end up isnt it if you really do love me palmer youll leave now please,3
ellie there is no reason you have to be alone,3
i cant hear this now,3
do you really think your life is meaningless eleanor is that why youre so quick to risk it because if your life means nothing then you have nothing to lose,3
i dont know,3
and then what then youll be safe,3
dont you understand i just have to hold it together just until tomorrow,3
im in love with you ellie,3
please,3
what are my other options in fifty years never,3
please palmer if you care for me at all dont push this now,3
what are you so afraid of,3
i cant do this,3
what,3
im sorry i cant,3
ellie what is it,3
what is it,3
im sorry,3
what,3
maybe thats okay,3
i do seem to be maybe because im just a little bit terrified about tomorrow,3
youre trembling,3
thank you,3
during the crusades pilgrims who made the journey to the holy land brought back a palm frond to show theyd actually been there i thought it sort of made sense that earth is now your holy land so,3
oh i brought you something,3
the final countdown,3
so the final countdown,3
i remember you were indelicate indiscreet and entirely less than tactful sound like anyone you know,3
ellie the last time we spoke i said some things,3
what if their answer is oh thats easy a thousand years ago our world was in terrible shape our population out of control violent crime no food so we called a general council and decided to eliminate the anitsocial the weak the sick the unwanted and ever since weve been doing great,3
how do you mean,3
an excellent question doctor but what if we dont like the answer,3
another question i would ask would be a very simple one how did you do it how did you evolve as far as you have and not destroy yourselves,3
its late we should go back,3
ellie,3
what are you so afraid of ellie,3
its getting late,3
and yet youre willing to die for this cause the one thing thats given your life a sense of purpose dont you see the contradiction here,3
relax its okay take a deep breath,3
oh i suck i suck,3
okay,3
well hurry up i want to be at mrs rosemonds before lunch,3
im in the bath mom,3
dont you raise your voice at me go to your room now,3

annette,3
you wanted an answer to your question,3
mind if i ask what youre doing in my room,3
i have a flair for drama,3
a little melodramatic dont you think,3
i knew this guy last summer in the hamptons he and his girlfriend at the time were madly in love with each other but she had this huge weight problem his friends taunted him mercilessly about it you know how do you breathe when she sits on your face its embarrassing for you to be seen with her finally he couldnt take it anymore and decided to dump her she flipped and he went on the defensive i distinctly remember him saying the same thing over and over again im completely fucked up im completely fucked up im completely fucked up poor fatty never had a chance,3
screening calls any suggestions,3
how have you dumped girls in the past,3
ive never done this before,3
why so nervous,3
then do me a favor and get rid of her if not for me then do it for you look at yourself youre a joke shes turned you into jelly what do you want to be one of those losers who walk down the halls holding hands and smiling people used to respect you they feared you and now youre going to throw that all away,3
thats not fair youre taking all the fun out of it,3
is that what you think,3
i cant believe youre reacting this way youre just saying this because you lost the bet,3
not anymore you dont its obvious,3
kathryn you know i love you ive always loved you,3
at first it was but now its become something bigger,3
oh come on kathryn it was just a contest,3
im sorry its just upsetting youre in love with her you dont love me anymore,3
whats wrong with you why are you acting this way,3
pwhipped pwhipped,3

oh my god youre completely pwhipped,3

no tell me,3
i know thats the amazing part of it i mean it wasnt like cirque du soleil acrobatics just standard missionary stuff but it was ah forget it im going to sound like a hallmark card,3
oh come on for her first time,3
it was fantastic,3
tell me all the details,3
oh yes,3
you didnt,3
well you obviously wanted me to witness your little adventure or else you wouldnt have invited me in,3

bad time,3
she wouldnt say she apologized to your aunt and told her she was going to stay with some friends you blew it sebastian that girl has come to her senses and she will never go near you again,3
whered she go,3
you dont know she left thirty minutes ago,3
where is she,3
if youre heading towards her room you wont find her,3
a momentary lapse of judgment soon to be rectified,3
i dont know she was lying on the bed ready to do it but i i dont i was i just didnt feel right about it,3
so what went wrong,3
exactly the opposite,3
she shot you down,3
if your asking if i nailed her the answer is no,3
well i know how it went with cecile she wont shut up about it howd it go with mrs jesus,3
with who,3
so howd it go last night,3

do you mind if i take my new porsche for a ride,3
im not losing the bet its just taking longer than i expected,3
and thats why youre losing your bet,3
if you must know yes i dont know what to do i cant stand that holier than thou bullshit and yet im completely infatuated with her she made me laugh,3
shes really getting to you isnt she,3

what are the terms,3
could you be more desperate to read it,3
oh gee your journal could you be more queer,3
oh well duty calls time to add another chapter to my work of art,3
ill think about it,3
care to make a wager on that,3
you dont stand a chance even this is out of your league,3
it just so happens were not in kansas anymore our little angels father has accepted the new headmaster position at oakwood shes staying with my aunt up in connecticut while daddy sells his house can you imagine what this would do for my reputation screwing the new headmasters virginal daughter before school starts it will be my greatest victory,3
bfd what do you plan to do fly to kansas and woo little dorothy,3
oh yes ive read it over and over again this babys the real deal daddys little angel a paradigm of chastity and virtue,3
jesus christ is she for real,3
shut up and turn to page 64,3
im not interested in the latest dating tips from jonathan taylor thomas,3
that was just simple revenge what i have planned requires sheer genius,3
oh but diddling the therapists daughter is a challenge,3
oh come on kathryn its too easy but i thought high school was only four years i mean please she knows nothing shes seen nothing i could have her under the table at au bar sucking me off before the appetizer arrived go get one of those moron friends of yours to do it i have a reputation to uphold,3
why not,3
sounds intriguing,3
i need you to seduce our young cecile introduce her to your world of decadence and debauchery,3
i see your point though why should i care,3
because if theres an attack made on court it could be traced back to me i cant allow that to happen everybody loves me and i intend to keep it that way,3
why go through cecile why not just attack court,3
keep your friends close and your enemies closer when i get through with her shell be the premier blow job queen of the tristate area and poor little courts heart will be shattered,3
so thats what this is all about well get together and plan your curriculum,3
i dont find this very funny,3
you dont mean,3
in any event my feelings were hurt when i learned that he had fallen for someone else someone chaste pure innocent,3
sorry,3
what,3
oh poor baby well you can relax i have a mission for you,3
hopefully though she suspects that your decrepit alcoholic father is diddling the maid,3
lovely how is your gold digging whore of a mother enjoying bali zipping through my inheritance per usual,3
im just taking the poor girl under my wing,3
do you care to tell me what mrs whitetrash and her stupid daughter are doing in my house,3
outstanding,3
ceciles attending oakwood in the fall,3
its the least i can do,3
oh please i cant have you do that,3
let me get that for you,3
absolutely,3
you will be discreet about this,3
i cant thank you enough,3
black,3
i know shes so young and hes so,3
ronald thats crazy,3
its worse i think theres something going on between cecile and her music teacher,3
kathryn you have my word it isnt drugs is it,3
well you promise you wont say anything to her weve developed a friendship and,3
what about her,3
its cecile,3
not at all whats wrong,3
i hope i didnt keep you from something,3
i got your message and came as quick as i could,3
like your stepbrother sebastian i cant believe they didnt expel him after what he did to the school nurse,3
dont worry its totally understandable most of the boys that matriculate at oakwood are very upstanding gentleman however there are the occasional bad apples,3
thats beautiful,3
i know this sounds corny but whenever i feel temptations of peer pressure i turn to god and he helps me through the problem call me an anachronism but it works,3
how do you do it i mean with all peer pressuring that goes on in high school where do you get your strength,3
youre too kind,3
ill do my best,3
i cant tell you how happy we are that cecile is going to be attending oakwood with you this fall youve always been an inspiration to beau and i on raising her we just hope she can rise to the high standards which youve set for her,3
i guess that puts me in my place thank you for the hospitality mrs caldwell it was a true awakening,3
oh dont give me any of that racist crap my husband and i gave money to colin powell,3
first of all maam i never touched your daughter and second i would like to think that in these times someone of your status could look beyond racial lines,3
whatever you are never to set foot in this house again and you are never and i mean never to see my daughter again is that understood,3
got me off the streets i live on 59th and park,3
is that so,3
mrs caldwell i think youre misunderstanding something,3
im paying you to give cello lessons not to pervert my child,3
excuse me,3

theyre given to the living in memory of the dead if this is a real one i cant be sure you can make a wish and it will come true in the twinkling of an eye,3

a ring that i can wish on like i wished on the candles,3
i wouldnt be surprised if it were a true wishing ring,3

sometimes i wonder if the guys were supposed to want to go out with are the ones we actually want to go out with you know,3
bianca i dont think the highlights of dating joey dorsey are going to include dooropening and coatholding,3
combination i dont know i thought hed be different more of a gentleman,3
is he oily or dry,3
he practically proposed when he found out we had the same dermatologist i mean dr bonchowski is great an all but hes not exactly relevant party conversation,3
would you mind getting me a drink cameron,3

i guess i thought i was protecting you,3
im not stupid enough to repeat your mistakes,3
thats not,3
no you didnt if you really thought i could make my own decisions you wouldve let me go out with him instead of helping daddy hold me hostage,3
i wanted to let you make up your own mind about him,3
why didnt you tell me,3
after that i swore id never do anything just because everyone else was doing it and i havent since except for bogeys party and my stunning gastrointestinal display,3
but,3
just once afterwards i told him i didnt want to anymore i wasnt ready he got pissed then he broke up with me,3
you did what,3
he said everyone was doing it so i did it,3
as in,3
now i do back then was a different story,3

like you care,3
listen i know you hate having to sit home because im not susie high school,3
youre welcome,3
i dont get you you act like youre too good for any of this and then you go totally apeshit when you get here,3
i really dont think i need any social advice from you right now,3
bianca i need to talk to you i need to tell you,3
can we go now,3
you are so completely unbalanced,3
yeah hes your freak friend mandellas boyfriend i guess since im not allowed to go out i should obsess over a dead guy too,3
its shakespeare maybe youve heard of him,3
like im supposed to know what that even means,3
at least im not a clouted fen sucked hedgepig,3
cant you forget for just one night that youre completely wretched,3
bogey lowensteins party is normal but youre too busy listening to bitches who need prozac to know that,3
whats normal,3
youre ruining my life because you wont be normal i cant be normal,3
i think youre a freak i think you do this to torture me and i think you suck,3
what do you think,3
oh i thought you might have a date i dont know why im bothering to ask but are you going to bogey lowensteins party saturday night,3
it means that gigglepuss is playing at club skunk and were going,3

i have the potential to smack the crap out of you if you dont get out of my way,3
nowhere hi daddy,3
whereve you been,3
i have a date daddy and he s not a captain of oppression like some men we know,3
im missing something,3

youre not going unless your sister goes end of story,3
hes not a hot rod whatever that is,3
its that hot rod joey right that s who you want me to bend my rules for,3
no but,3
the prom kat has a date,3
daddy i want to discuss the prom with you its tomorrow night,3

its just a party daddy,3
oh god its starting,3
if kats not going youre not going,3
daddy people expect me to be there,3
its just a party daddy but i knew youd forbid me to go since gloria steinem over there isnt going,3
otherwise known as an orgy,3
if you must know we were attempting to go to a small study group of friends,3
and wherere you going,3
daddy i,3
exactly my point,3
but she doesnt want to date,3
but its not fair shes a mutant daddy,3
then neither will you and ill get to sleep at night,3
what if she never starts dating,3
no youre not dating until your sister starts dating end of discussion,3
now dont get upset daddy but theres this boy and i think he might ask,3
just sent em through,3
padua girls one tall decent body the other one kinda short and undersexed,3
never,3
fan of a fan you see a couple of minors come in,3
didnt have you pegged for a gigglepuss fan arent they a little too preteen bellybutton ring for you,3

best case scenario youre back on the payroll for awhile,3
you humiliated the woman sacrifice yourself on the altar of dignity and even the score,3
no i m not,3
buttholus extremus but hey youre making progress,3
the hell is that what kind of guy just picks up a girl and carries her away while youre talking to her,3
extremely unfortunate maneuver,3
hell ive just been going over the whole thing in my head and,3
you told me that part already,3
its her favorite band,3
assail your ears for one night,3
okay i wasnt sure,3
hes pretty,3
dead at fortyone,3
her favorite uncle,3
its a lung cancer issue,3
number one she hates smokers,3
are you kidding hell piss himself with joy hes the ultimate kiss ass,3
will bogey get bent,3
in that case well need to make it a schoolwide blow out,3
this is it a golden opportunity patrick can ask katarina to the party,3
like we had a choice besides when you let the enemy think hes orchestrating the battle youre in a position of power we let him pretend hes calling the shots and while hes busy setting up the plan you have time to woo bianca,3
you got him involved,3
hey ive gotta have a few clients when i get to wall street,3

i hear youre helpin verona,3
so what you need to do is recruit a guy wholl go out with her someone whos up for the job,3

i appreciate your efforts toward a speedy death but im consuming do you mind,3
neither has his heterosexuality,3
thats never been proven,3

william would never have gone to a state school,3
so he has this huge raging fit about sarah lawrence and insists that i go to his maledominated puking frat boy number one golf team school i have no say at all,3
you could always go with me im sure william has some friends,3
the people at this school are so incredibly foul,3
i realize that the men of this fine institution are severely lacking but killing yourself so you can be with william shakespeare is beyond the scope of normal teenage obsessions youre venturing far past daytime talk show fodder and entering the world of those who need very expensive therapy,3
an attempted slit,3
whats this,3
just a little,3
mandella eat starving yourself is a very slow way to die,3
block e,3

hes the devils child,3
with a face like that i dont want you looking at me you hear,3
ah leave him alone hes doing no harm,3
what are you listening to chicken ass,3
youll be drinking your own piss for the glory of spain and admiral colon bastard,3
the waters going putrid in the barrels,3
i never seen heat like this not even in las minas,3
ifgodwillsit,3
asia can be found to the west and i will prove it,3
blind faith is what i consider heresy,3
dont you realize your words could be considered heretical,3
did he not choose a carpenters son to reveal himself to the world,3
if god intended our proximity to asia do you believe he would have waited for you to show it to the world,3
no the portuguese have already discovered blackskinned people i too will find other populations and bring them to the word of god,3
is that all that interests you gold,3
trade your excellency according to marco polo the kingdom of china is one of the richest of the world even the meanest buildings are roofed with gold,3
if they agree to follow me yes,3
your life and that of others,3
your eminence there is only one way to settle the matter and that is to make the journey i am ready to risk my life to prove it possible,3
excellency you are right,3
senor colon an experienced captain such as yourself will understand our concern with the crew i am not willing to have on my conscience the loss of men who would have relied upon our judgment,3
then you cannot ignore that according to their calculations the circumference of the earth is approximately 22000 leagues or more which makes the ocean uncrossable,3
i am your eminence,3
unfortunately don colon that is precisely where our opinions differ are you familiar with the work of aristotle erathostene ptolemeus,3
yes your eminence the voyage should not take more than six or seven weeks,3
you say asia can be found by sailing west,3
a waste let me tell you something arojaz if your name or mine is ever remembered it will only be because of his,3
what a tragedy what a waste of a life,3
you can see for yourself,3
on the contrary your eminence it seems to me the man is preparing his own cross,3
it wont be easy to get rid of your prophet now don sanchez,3
indeed the world is full of mercenaries and states often make use of them when it benefits them my only concern is the welfare and prosperity of spain,3
he is a mercenary did he not already try to convince the king of portugal of his absurd notions,3
naturally but i would really deplore the loss of such a potential opportunity for spain for a dispute over a point of geography,3
the judgment is ours,3
the state has some reason to be interested in this mans proposition your eminence,3
i cant keep my eyes off you i would like to catch up with all the moments i didnt spend with you,3
what is it now tell me,3
i am busy inside,3
cant you stay with us a little,3
not everything do you think i care im a free man again riches dont make a man rich they only make him busier,3
they took everything,3
they tried but i didnt let them,3
god youre so beautiful i cant believe no other man has ever taken you away from me,3
i can arrange for the queen to take fernando and diego into her service,3
you dont usually ask,3
beatrix i want to ask you something,3
thats something you cant decide,3
i dont want you to wait for me,3
im not asking you to swear to anything,3
thank god,3
she said yes,3
i find that hard to believe,3
perhaps i was never meant to live with a woman,3
id love to argue with you sometimes but youre never here,3
are we going to argue,3
well thats true i have a child by a man who wont marry me whos always leaving,3
i havent given you much of a life,3
i know,3
i could be gone for years,3
i am afraid this is not the worst news,3
how could i be the mainland has been found exactly as i said it would,3
i am not a seaman but i heard it is no more than a week at sea i hope you are not too disappointed,3
how far from here,3

i understand that you will soon be appointing governors for the islands is it not so,3
tell me the first thing that comes to your mind,3
really god i wouldnt know where to start and yet,3
i want you to tell me everything you remember father from the beginning everything,3
he never had one except aboard my ships,3
he asks when he can come to visit you he left his address,3
what does he say,3
i am not listening father but i cant help hearing,3
what are you listening to,3
there must be a passage to that other ocean,3
father,3
not bad,3
how are you feeling fernando,3

all of them created by people like me,3
roofs towers palaces spires,3
what do you see,3
look out of that window,3
i am not afraid of you you are nothing but a dreamer,3
call them,3
all i have to do is call the guards,3
to rise so high in so short a time is a dangerous occupation a little hypocrisy goes a long way,3
what do i have so many already,3
you seem to have a special talent for making friends,3
good we are also in need of judges except there are no thieves,3
don bobadilla is already a judge my dear don cristobal,3
but we do have a lack of notaries you should contact my administration,3
for a commoner,3
you defend yourself admirably,3
forgive me don colon but what about gold,3
they dont see sin in their nakedness they live according to nature in a never ending summer the islands are covered with trees filled with blossoms and fruits and,3
if you wont accept our proposal well simply find someone who will,3
and were you never ambitious excellency or is ambition only a virtue among the nobles a fault for the rest of us,3
then you are too ambitious,3
im not bargaining,3
i remind you senor colon that you are in no position to bargain with me,3
no i have waited too long fought too hard now you expect me to take all the risks while you take the profit no i will not be your servant,3
no,3
no,3
you never learned how to speak my language,3
utapan wont you speak to me you used to know how to speak to me,3
you did the same to your god,3
you have to find them utapan look what they did,3
ask him if he will help,3
he understands,3
we will work with his people we want peace ask the chief if he understands,3
he has medicine tell him we admire his people,3
chief says,3
and also to bring medicine,3
chief says he has a god,3
to bring the word of god,3
why,3
thousands,3
chief says how many,3
tell him his country is very beautiful tell him we are leaving men here to build a fort,3
chief knows,3
tell the chief we thank him,3
you come you speak first,3

oh so you are a new man,3
new worlds create new people,3
i knew you would,3
i have to disagree,3
youll always be older than me father,3
i suppose were both old men now,3
give me absolution,3
i believed in you,3
you are bound by an oath father,3
my son my son your certitudes are sometimes frightening christopher you must speak to them and if you dont i will,3
if i tell them they wont follow me you know that i am right father you trust me,3
may god forgive you you must tell them you must tell your men,3
i am not sure it could be twice the distance,3
how long,3
i lied the journey will be longer than i said,3
what are you saying,3
father i have betrayed my family i betrayed my men and i betrayed you,3
i am listening my son,3
forgive me father for i have sinned,3

whyd you help me back there with the chief whyd you stand up for me like that,3
how you go out on a limb for somebody is by giving her a number of an immigration lawyer here heres a number of an immigration lawyer thats how you help her but you cant get involved in her like that youre gonna jeopardize your career your life and youre gonna jeopardize my case and lemme give you another piece of advice maybe you dont watch tv but ill let you in on a little secret the whole fuckin world watches television and when you get out there they know your face and the little fame the little fuckin itty bitty fame that i get in this city makes it a lot easier for my job and i get more done because of it,3
but i mean didnt you ever go out on a limb for somebody i mean you shoulda heard her there tellin her whole storyi believed her,3
well its not up to you to decide whether shes innocent or not dont you understand thats why youre a professional,3
i told you you know i thought i was doing the right thing you know i think shes innocent,3
no i dont think you were a fool i just think you were stupid about it i mean to say the least you outta know better you dont know her well enough shes got the potential to fucking hang you even if she suggests that you made a pass at her its fuckin over you can deny it all you want but it will not make one fucking bit of difference youre dead,3
yeah just her in the shower nothing happened look im sure you probably think im a fool and i fucked up but,3
just a shower,3
i took her there for a shower and thats it,3
well you shoulda because nobodys gonna believe you didntincluding me,3
look eddie im tellin you i didnt touch her,3
women like that have a way of turning professionals into amateurs,3
hey im a professional,3
okay tell you what ill give you a head start you take her to the station house dont let her out of your sight shes the only warm body we got left,3
you know what im saying here,3
youre her savior is she the kid youre gonna save from the burning building,3
cmon you intimidate her cause youre a celebrity she sees me differently,3
so am i,3
im serious here,3
my point exactly,3
i dont have a girlfriend,3

you wanna talk to her alone,3
look let me talk to her any leads i get theyre all yours just let me have a first crack at her,3
raw deal,3
shes fucked even if that story is true,3
something back home,3
why not,3
is that all there is,3
she just saw two of her friends killed they probably threatened her,3
what are you hiding why are you afraid,3
then i guess were doin this the right way arent we if we pull up to a burning building ill gladly let you go first,3
i wanted to run up to a building on fire kick in the door rush into the smoke and save a kid,3
hey i always wanted to be a cop when i was a kid i dreamed of running up to a door kicking it in pulling my gun and yelling freeze at the bad guy whatd you dream about,3

ill come with you,3
or czechoslovakia the slavs have been fighting the germans and the russians for a thousand years these are very intense people and they take things personally,3
eastern europe like what romania hungary,3
maybe its a ritual thing or someone trying to send a message burial rites are taken very seriously in eastern europe it could be to humiliate them just burning them up no proper funeral its like condemning them to hell,3
look im not even sure she has anything to do with this i saw her outside after the fire thought it was a lead maybe she saw something maybe she was visiting somebody here who knows,3
what would you call her,3
who says shes a suspect,3
maybe you dont care about that either prettiest suspect ive had in awhile,3
hmmmm,3
pretty,3
the super said hed seen her before but she didnt live here,3
you were right they were both dead before the fire the male was stabbed so hard the killer broke off the tip of the knife in his spine thats usually an indicator of something personal,3
if you found me steppin on your crime scene it might piss you off too what about the report,3

the clerk,3
capra thats not czech or russian who said he sounded russian,3
room was registered to a francis capra,3
that doesnt apply to me because im not a criminal im not a criminal i wasnt convicted,3
but doesnt the son of sam law prevent criminals from profiting from their crimes,3
were in negotiations thats correct,3
and isnt there a movie in the works about you,3
look im in here you call this a career move,3
permanently disrupted arent you selling paintings now for quite a lot of money hasnt this incident as you call it jump started your career as an artist,3
look im a victim here too i was a year away from getting my masters in art now ill never graduate my life has been permanently disrupted,3
you seem very savvy for a man whos been found mentally incompetent to stand trial,3
it was my finger that pulled the trigger but im not morally responsible my psychiatrist knew what i was capable of how could i know im not a doctor,3
so you feel absolutely no responsibility for killing these people,3
yes my psychiatrist didnt insist that i stay on my medication,3
your doctor,3
this had nothing to do with shoes that didnt fit or my relationship with my father who as you know made a fortune selling penny loafers in the fifties these people died because of the criminal actions of my doctor,3
were trying to get there i hope we can,3
continued,3
im sorry dr smyslov but im really not at liberty to discuss this,3
continued,3
how did they manage to do that without any communication,3
continued,3
well i suppose theyve been having a bit of trouble with some of the equipment,3
continued,3
shes wonderful,3
continued,3
im afraid ive only got a few minutes but id love to,3
continued,3
well how nice to see you again elena youre looking wonderful,3
space stattion 5 lounge,3
roger,3
i think ill have to go out and burn them off,3
i guess not,3
i guess you dont know your own strength old boy,3
i didnt do that frank i took particular care not to freeze them,3
well now that weve got one thats actually failed we should be able to figure out whats happened and fix it,3
its the last one,3
yes,3
hal,3
well i hope theres nothing wrong with the assembly on those other wise were out of business,3
two more,3
two units in four days how many spares do we have,3
i dont know hal said he thought it might be the assembly procedure,3
no,3
youre kidding,3
well hals reported the aounit about to fail again,3
oh im fine im wide awake whats up,3
are you reasonably awake,3
good morning hows it going,3
anyway its just as well that we replace it better safe than sorry,3
yes but its more likely that the tolerances on our testing gear are too low,3
i suppose computers have been known to be wrong,3
yes i dont know what to make of it,3
well thats something,3
still all we have to do is ask hal,3
i guess it isnt,3
i suppose it isnt logically impossible,3
but not completely inconceivable,3
i know it would be almost inconceivable,3
yes but its to fantastic to think that theyd keep something from us,3
not really though it is strange when you think about it it didnt really make any sense to keep us apart during training,3
thats true,3
just ask hal its conceivable they might keep something from us but theyd never keep anything from hal,3
how,3
of course it would be very easy for us to find out now,3
yes i thought so,3
that seems very unlikely,3
i dont know all i heard is that theres something about the mission we werent told,3
oh well apparently theres something about the mission that the sleeping beauties know that we dont know and thats why we were trained separately and thats why they were put to sleep before they were even taken aboard,3
no as a matter of fact i didnt,3
yes you must have heard the rumour that went around during orbital checkout,3
oh,3
i suppose so though of course theres a more sinister explanation,3
i suppose the idea was specialized training,3
no i never did either,3
i must say i never did understand why they split us into two groups for training,3
i dont think we should make any fuss about it yet im sure theyll straighten it out,3
well what do you think we ought to do about it,3
its possible,3
not really they just said it might be because we trained at houston and they trained in marshall and that were being charged against differ ent accounting offices,3
yesterday i finally called the accounting office at mission control and all they could tell me was that theyd received the ags19 notification for the other three but not mine and apparently not yours either,3
yes,3
really,3
interesting that you mention it because ive got the same problem,3
thats right well naturally i didnt say anything to payroll i assumed theyd start paying me at the higher grade on the next pay cheque but its been almost three weeks now and im still being paid as an ags18,3
well i got the papers on my official upgrading to ags19 two weeks before we left,3
yes,3
its about my salary cheques,3
whats up,3
well its nothing really important but its annoying,3
sure what is it,3
dave if youve a minute id like your advice on something,3
okay come on down,3
okay,3
right just a sec,3
hi frank coming in please,3
listen to me very carefully hal unless you immediately release the hibernation control and follow every order i give from this point on i will immediately got to control central and carry out a complete disconnection,3
i know that youve had that on your mind for some time now dave but it would be a crying shame since i am so much more capable of carrying out this mission than you are and i have such enthusiasm and confi dence in the mission,3
i am prepared to do that anyway,3
hal unless you follow my instructions i shall be forced to disconnect you,3
im sorry dave but in accordance with subroutine c15324 quote when the crew are dead or incapacitated the computer must assume control unquote i must therefore override your authority now since you are not in any condition to intel ligently exercise it,3
hal im in command of this ship i order you to release the manual hibernation control,3
i can tell from the tone of your voice dave that youre upset why dont you take a stress pill and get some rest,3
i dont like to assert myself dave but it would be much better now for you to rest youve been involved in a very stressful situation,3
hal switch to manual hibernation control,3
look dave yourve probably got a lot to do i suggest you leave it to me,3
im goin to do this myself hal let me have the control please,3
if youre determined to revive the crew now i can handle the whole thing myself theres no need for you to trouble,3
i dont really agree with you dave my onboard memory store is more than capable of handling all the mission requirements,3
it doesnt have to be hal its more dangerous to be out of touch with earth let me have manual control please,3
repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation,3
the antenna has to be replaced,3
i suppose its because youve been under a lot of stress but have you forgotten that theyre not supposed to be revived for another three months,3
i suppose youre pretty broken up about it,3
yes it is,3
too bad about frank isnt it,3
well thats a relief you know i have the greatest enthusiasm possible for the mission,3
yes it is hal,3
is your confidence in me fully restored,3
and dont you worry about it,3
well dont worry about it,3
im sorry about the misunderstanding hal,3
naturally dave im not pleased that the aounit has failed but i hope at least this has restored your confidence in my integrity and reliability i certainly wouldnt want to be disconnected even temporarily as i have never been disconnected in my entire service history,3
okay hal well lets see the way things go from here on,3
look dave i know that youre sincere and that youre trying to do a competent job and that youre trying to be helpful but i can assure the problem is with the aounits and with your test gear,3
hal is there anything bothering you anything that might account for this problem,3
im not questioning your word dave but its just not possible im not capable of being wrong,3
yes i know that but i can assure you that they were about to fail,3
you probably also know that we found them okay,3
yes i know,3
you know that we checked the two aounits that you reported in imminent failure condition,3
sure dave whats up,3
not now hal id like to talk to you about something,3
i understand hal well take care of it please let me have the hard copy,3
the unit is still operational dave but it will fail within seventytwo hours,3
my fpc shows an impending failure of the antenna orientation unit,3
what is it hal,3
sorry to interrupt the festivities dave but i think weve got a problem,3
hes got a point,3
im sorry frank but i dont think i can answer that question without knowing everything that all of you know,3
well the only important aspect of the mission are where are we going what will we do when we get there when are we coming back and why are we going,3
continued,3
still you really dont believe it do you,3
continued,3
well its silly but if you want to why dont you,3
coninued,3
well what is it,3
continued,3
did they have any explanation for this,3
continued,3
yes i remember you mentioning it i got mine about the same time,3
continued,3
goodbye daddy,3
bye bye now sweetheart,3
yes daddy,3
ill wish you a happy birthday now and ill see you soon all right darling,3
thank you daddy,3
okay sweetheart have a lovely birthday party tomorrow,3
three darling one two three be sure to tell mommy i called,3
how many days until you come home,3
okay sweetheart well i have to go now tell mommy that i called,3
shes in the bathroom,3
where is mrs brown,3
mommys out to the hair dresser,3
one two three can i speak to mommy,3
in three days darling i hope,3
when are you coming home,3
no im sorry darling i told you i wont be home for a few days,3
are you coming to my party,3
yes i know that sweetheart,3
im having a party tomorrow,3
im fine daddy when are you coming home,3
im at space station five darling how are you,3
ill bet its a fortune,3
i was working out what this trip must cost taking him up there by himself and coming back empty,3
yes well whatever it is theyre certainly not fooling around this is the first flight they allowed in for more than a week,3
berkeley told me that they think it came from contamination on a returning mars flight,3
i suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later,3
well ive heard more and more people talk of an epidemic,3
well hows it going back there,3
thank you,3
oh thank you very much,3
thank you its been a great pleasure to meet all of you dr smyslov,3
well gregor and i will look forward to seeing you,3
well i hope that you and your wife can come to the iac conference in june,3
no thank you and im afraid now i really must be going,3
are you sure you wont change your mind about a drink,3
well that does sound very odd,3
clavius control came on the air just long enough to transmit their refusal,3
well where are all of you off to,3
hes fine but im afraid we dont get a chance to see each other very much these days,3
how is gregor,3
oh thats such a delightful age,3
oh shes growing up very fast as a matter of fact shes six tomorrow,3
and your charming little daughter,3
yes its coming along very well,3
i suppose you saw the work on our new section while you were docking,3
yes i think so just about then,3
fine,3
well shall we go through documentation,3
yes very pleasant,3
well did you have a pleaant flight,3
please it really doesnt matter,3
well thank you very much for being so understanding,3
im terribly sorry i was just on my way down to meet you i saw your ship dock and i knew i had plenty of time and i was on my way out of the office when suddenly the phone rang,3
how do you do mr miller,3
dr smyslov im not permitted to discuss this,3
this epidemic could easily spread to our base dr floyd we should be given all the facts,3
quite frankly we have had some very reliable intelligence reports that a quite serious epidemic has broken out at clavius something apperently of an unknown origin is this in fact what has happened,3
certainly,3
dr floyd at the risk of pressing you on a point you seem reticent to discuss may i ask you a straightforward question,3
well im glad about that,3
fortunately they did,3
yes well i hope the crew got back safely,3
yes and im afaid theres going to be a bit of a row about it denying the men permission to land was a direct violation of the ias convention,3
i see,3
thats right,3
you mean you havent been able to get anyone at the base for ten days,3
yes well at first we thought that was the explanation but its been going on for the past ten days,3
yes well for one thing whenever you phone the base all you can get is a recording which repeats that the phone lines are temporarily out of order,3
really,3
well its just for the past two weeks there have been some extremely odd things happening at clavius,3
im sorry but im not sure i know what you mean,3
yesas a matter of fact i am,3
are you by any chance going up to your base at clavius,3
well as it happens im on my way up to the moon,3
yes really thank you very much,3
are you quite sure,3
oh i really dont have time for a drink if its all right ill just sit for a minute and then ive got to be off,3
i dont think it has but id like to check that simpson whats the log on that,3
has it been exposed to any sun before now,3
well not really at first glance black would suggest something sunpowered but then why would anyone deliberately bury a sun powered device,3
any ideas about the colour,3
tomb shine surveymarker spare part take your choice,3
but you dont have any idea as to what it is,3
not really its completely inert no sound or energy sources have been detected the surface is made of something incredibly hard and weve been barely able to scratch it a laser drill,3
any clue as to what it is,3
by the deformation between the mother rock and the fill,3
how can you tell it was deliberately buried,3
yes it does the subsurface structure shows that it was deliberately buried about four million years ago,3
im afraid it can and it will be kept under wraps as long as it is deemed to be necessary by the council and of course you know that the council has requested that formal security oaths are to be obtained in writing from every one who had any knowledge of this event there must be adequate time for a full study to be made of the situation before any con sideration can be given to making a public announcement,3
dr floyd how long do you think this can be kept under wraps,3
well thank you very much and please let us know if there is anything we can do to make your trip more comfortable,3
no of course captain i can understand your concern,3
well fine thanks very much anyway and i hope you dont mind me asking,3
yes well i wouldnt have been too concerned about it except ive heard these stories about the epidemic and as a matter of fact ive heard that ten people have died already,3
i see well im sorry about that i wouldnt think theres any cause for alarm,3
well ill tell you why i ask you see ive got a girl who works in the auditing department of the territorial administrator and i havent been able to get her on the phone for the past week or so and with all these stories one hears im a little concerned about her,3
i take it this is something to do with the trouble theyre having up at clavius,3
i see,3
well the crew is confined to the ship when we land at clavius we have to stay inside for the time it take to refit about twentyfour hours and then were going to back empty,3
what do you mean,3
incidentally dr floyd i wonder if i can have a word with you about the security arrangements,3
thank you,3
oh no thank you the two girls have taken wonderful care of me im just fine,3
were scheduled to dock in about seven hours is there anything we can do for you,3
when do we arrive at clavius,3
theres nothing like weightless sleep for a complete rest,3
oh marvellous its the first real sleep ive had for the past two days,3
all right hal well take care of it let me have the hard copy please,3
not really frank i think there may be a flaw in the assembly procedure,3
do you have any idea of what is causing this fault,3

when you been in prison three years it dont take long lets go,3
that was quick,3
i can just take her right across the street to luthers hotel all i need is some money for the room,3
yeah i see her,3
yeah guess not,3
bein good at your job dont explain everything jack,3
thanks for callin in and i guess maybe look im sorry i called you watermellon nigger those kinds of things i was just leanin on ya doin my job,3
you sure thats the reason,3
i dont know why but im going to let you keep it maybe because you told me you had it or maybe just because im too tired to argue,3
forget it i want ganz as bad as you do and i got some other news for you,3
tell me something why didnt you just take the money off luther and split,3
so you took the rest of the night off,3
they must have set up a meeting for the morning luther left an 8 am wakeup and put up the dont disturb sign hes trading his girl for the money all we have to do to grab ganz is not go blind,3
let him get some sleep hes going to need it,3
maybe we should pay luther a visit,3
you missed luther took a taxi to the hotel across the street made a phone call,3
we missed,3
what about ganz,3
what about luther,3
hello and goodbye,3
be polite say hello this is candy,3
wheres luther,3
ill be there in a minute you dont move your ass right,3
hey jack how ya doin what took you so long to call man i been waitin im at vromans up in the fillmore yeah vromans course you dont hang out here its for the brothers,3
no way,3
you stay with me,3
bullshit then im staying with the money,3
right if you ever switch from armed robbery to pimping then youre all set,3
that was in style a couple years back man,3
yeah most cops are pretty dumb but since youre the one that landed in jail whats that make you,3
were getting too close cates whats the matter you been takin dumb pills,3
class isnt somethin you buy punk look at you five hundred dollar suit and youre still a lowlife,3
no class,3
what you dont understand is i dont give a damn about how this thing looks,3
you know id be embarrassed if i let my wheels go the way youve done with this job,3
yeah it doesnt look like hes gonna make it as a dangerous tough guy,3
a long time agb luther must of got the shit beat out of him so bad it just rattled his brain that would account for him making so many wrong moves in a row,3
if hes hoping that then hes dumber than i think he is which would be amazin cause i already think hes real dumb,3
maybe luther hopes ganzll give him a piece of your money,3
you got a very depressing view of life man you gotta smile once in awhile,3
im not in this cause its fun im not into hitting guys cause it makes me feel good either i do it cause it works,3
doesnt it get tiring,3
if they dont tell me what i need to know,3
say do you always work people over like you did luther,3
that aint philosophy thats common sense,3
i suppose youd never be like luther and let a woman get to you,3
oh yeah does bein in love make you stupid,3
im tellin you the mans in love he wants to be a hero for his girl,3
if i was his size and had ganz on my ass id just leave town,3
tryin to save his girl man hes in another world,3
youd think the guyd be smart enough to know he was being tailed,3
i had no choice some white asshole bought the last piece of shit skyblue cadillac,3
didnt know you darker people went in for foreign jobs,3
jesus christ look at all the dust on my carwhy in the hell dont he take it to a car wash,3
jesus christ thats a disgrace the guy pulls a gun on a cop and hes out in 24 hours i tell you some of the courts these days are just a fucking revolving door,3
musta got some primo bondsman,3
what,3
guess what luther just got in line,3
not really i figured ganz was put down for a long time and i knew luther would never job me on his own hes too chickenshit,3
you took a big chance leaving this here all this time,3
shit,3
i wasnt sure the money was still there until we saw luther you almost got your ass shot off for nothing once not twice jack,3
you son of a bitch you knew where the money was all along and all we had to do was come here and wait i almost got my ass blown off twice tonight for nothing,3
you just drove by it,3
for three years lets hope it wasnt a towaway zone,3
thisll show you how smart i am i got it parked,3
youre a real case you know that jack,3
wheres the goddamn car,3
yeah right,3
get this we aint partners we aint brothers we aint friends if ganz gets away with my money youre gonna be sorry we ever met,3
right partner,3
in the trunk of a car a lot better than under a mattress right,3
wheres the money,3
depends on how things work out i believe in the merit system so far you havent built up any points,3
you gonna let me keep any of it,3
not likely convict,3
we split 5050,3
you catch on real fastokay jack lets talk deal how much of my money you gonna let me keep,3
hes after your money,3
me and my bunch hit a dealer in the middle of a sale its the kind of money nobody ever reports stolen i was sittin pretty livin in the high cotton then somebody fingered me for another job some psycho whos out there capping people with some cops gun,3
just tell me about the money,3
jesus,3

they saved your ass convict,3
naw youd just call your pals back to bail you out one more time,3
yeah right you want to try again,3
who gives a goddamn what you think youre just a crook thats got a weekendpass youre not even a name anymore just a spear chucker with a goddamn number stenciled on the back of his prison fatigues,3
maybe i dont like the way you ask,3
luther knew more than he told me and so do younow you better tell we what the fuck this is all about i gave you 48 hours to come up with something and the clocks runnin,3
im impressed with you too jack you did a real good job of busting up a couple of dykes bedded down for the night,3

too bad it wouldve covered your ass now youre in the shit and sos the department in case you havent noticed this wasnt our finest hour i told you everyone was watchin on this one maybe you better start thinkin about writin tickets off a three wheel bike,3
i didnt have the time,3
dont duck the bullet cates why didnt you call in for backup instead of makin a grandstand play,3
right i screwed up i fucked up i messed up anybody could have done better especially you i bet youre real good at hitting targets through crowds,3

you might be more of a team player and a little less of a hot dog on this one jack,3
yeah it bothers me when cops get hurt while im makin a play i dont like it,3
anthing botherin you besides losin your gun,3
yeah,3
jack come on there is an official department policy about cop killings cop killers represent a special priority because any man crazy enough to kill a cop is a greater threat to an unarmed civilian in other words we cant seen like were in the revenge business i know we all know the truths a little different,3
hey the bastards got my gun i want it back,3
yeah i read the report,3
i want to be left alone on this one algren was killed with my gun,3
i guess when two cops die on account of your fuck up you want to keep it as quiet as possible,3
are you gonna tell me about police procedure do me a favor dont give me a bunch of crap,3
somebody steals your gun youre supposed to file a report,3
the truth hurts doesnt it buddy,3

so what,3
it might pay to reexamine a few of your more primitive notions i was in bed with a girlfriend watching tv last week jack and one thing we know about me is i happen not to be a lesbian now if this indians girlfriend got upset when you came looking for him it could just be shes still vulnerable to him,3
come on they were a little old for a slumber party,3

cornilius,3
appipulai leeloo minai,3
i know,3
you are a monster zorg,3
let me reassure you fatheri will never kill more people in my entire life than religion has killed in the last 2000 years,3
destroying a glass is one thingkilling people with the weapons you produce is quite another,3
father by creating a little destruction i am in fact encouraging life so in reality you and i are in the same business,3
they are robots,3
look at all these little things so busy all of a sudden notice how each one is useful what a lovely ballet so full of form and color so full oflife,3
follow me life which you so nobly serve comes from destruction look at this empty glass,3
no thank you,3
would you like a drink,3
ah father you are so wrong let me explain,3
im a priest im here to serve life all you want to do is destroy it,3
why whats wrong with me,3
even it i did know where the stones were i would never tell somebody like you,3
personally they are of no interest to me id rather sell weaponsbut i have a customer so tell me,3
why on earth do the stones interest you,3
im glad you got your memory back father because youre going to need it where are the stones,3
i remember you nowthe so called art dealer,3
zorg jeanbaptiste emmanuel zorg nice to see you again,3
im fucked,3
were saved,3
thats what im saying,3
and you dont know how they open is that what you are saying,3
yes of course but the stones are shut they have to be open for it to work,3
theres no light you told me there were supposed to be four beams of light,3
theoretically yes the four stones form the beam and the fifth element is supposed to stand in the middle there but i dont have the reference book ive never seen the stones work,3
dont tell me you dont know how all this works,3
uh have you tried the divas suite,3
when is she not in trouble,3
leeloos in trouble,3
yeah i know to save the world but right now all i want to do is save leeloo,3
youre probably very angry with me and i quite understand but i want you to know im fighting for a noble cause,3
trying to save your ass so you can save the world,3
what are you doing,3
father i was in the army for awhile and every time they told us we were on a mission to save the world the only thing that changed was i lost a lot of friends so thanks for the offer but no thanks,3
of course,3
good luck,3
we have to save the world,3
what kind of mission,3
were not going on vacationwere on a mission,3
is that the usual way priests go on vacation,3
im sorry to have to resort to such methods but we heard about your good luck on he radio and we need the tickets to fhloston,3
thats what i thought,3
it means never without my permission,3
excuse me just one thing she said something to me a while ago and i dont really get it akta gamat,3
i know i was there when she arrived,3
shes fine reallydont you worry just needs some restshes had a very long trip,3

theres not a moment to lose wake her up but be gentle about it this woman is mankinds most precious possession she is perfect,3
you noticed,3
hes a she,3
the girl,3
i brought the girl remember,3
who are you,3
she dropped in on me holding this,3
thats me but i dont know who she is where did you find her,3
shes not my bride shes my fare shes looking for this vito cornelius according to the phone guide he lives here,3
weddings are one floor down congratulations,3

white turns to black light to dark life to death for all eternity,3
but what happens if instead of this ultimate warrior it is evil who stands here,3
yesthank god,3
is there anything that can stop it,3
and then it will be too late the goal of evil is to wipe out life all forms of life for all eternitylife upsets it,3
and then,3
we have fortyeight hours the time it needs to adapt itself to our living conditions,3
thats exactly what we are going to try and do protect the lives of some 200 billion of our fellow citizens general you may fire when ready,3
time is of no importance mr president only life is important,3
your theory is interesting father but i dont think we have time to go into it right now,3
one more reason to shoot first eh,3
imagine for a moment that this thing is not anything that can be identified because it prefers not to be because it is the antithesis of all we are because it is evil total evil,3
later david later theres not a minute to lose,3
youre all safe thanks be to god,3
its all my fault im the servant its my mission here,3
on the plane with mr dallas the real one,3

i dont have time i need to know,3
i i dont know we hardly know each other it takes time,3

ill help her i promise but i think you should tell me where the stones are,3
she was taught to love the life of others but not her own you have to teach her to love if you want her to truly live,3
so cornelius was telling the truth,3
yes and more than that you must give her the stones shes the only one who knows how to use them,3

well well ill have to put my thinkingcap on about all this youll leave the money as a deposit very good,3

ill consider it,3
i want to watch you work,3

first things first you might want to watch this mr welles,3
sorry,3
fuck off,3

youre a dead man,3
move it dirtbag,3
dont let longdales questionable choice of weapon give you any ideas if his fey little gun puts enough little holes in you youll be just as dead and so will max,3
put the gun down take the handcuffs handcuff yourself to the bed,3
is that him,3
its good what youre doing,3
youre gonna be seeing a lot of me youre sure you dont mind,3
its horrible but itll be your best friend after a few days i hope you realize what kind of long shot youre chasing after,3
any good,3
files are mostly by state and year of disappearance we try to keep the children and adults separate no eating or smoking in here but theres a coffee machine in the hall,3
well thats all i can do sorry,3
they were pretty clear they didnt want this coming back on them,3
i can give you my card if your clients want to call me,3
theyre putting themselves in place of this kids parents and thinking theyd want to hear their girls okay even if thats all they hear,3
im not so sure about this,3
this doctor and wife theyre nice people but they dont want to get too involved theyre not trying to have the parents come looking for the girl either you and i both know sometimes not often but sometimes theres real reasons why a kidll run molestation whatever besides that the girls probably eighteen so shes legal,3
why dont they come to me,3
for whatever reasons i thought you might be more receptive,3
we do,3
i figured you share information,3
why not go to the ncic or ncmec,3
few days ago i was contacted by a couple living in philadelphia a doctor and his wife what happened was they picked up a young girl hitchhiking off 81 which heads into philadelphia started up a conversation with this girl she looked homeless seemed about eighteen maybe they convinced her to let them buy her a meal in the city nice kid mature didnt have much to say but they got a sense shes a runaway so all through dinner the doctors working on her trying to convince her that at the very least she should pick up a telephone not surprisingly she ate her food excused herself thats the last they saw her the reason they came to me for help the reason im coming to you is we had a friend of mine in the department work up a sketch they want to see if i can id this girl somehow pass along a message to let the parents know the kids alive doing alright,3
absolutely of course ill abide by whatever decision you make but id appreciate if youll hear me out,3
there are reasons for the way we do things here,3
what id like very simply is access to your archive and now i understand this isnt something you normally do for private citizens,3
alright tom,3
call me tom,3
what can i do for you mr welles,3
what do you want you want me to fall to my knees and start crying like a baby,3
thats right you just stood there and watched because you felt like it almost makes you worse,3
i never killed anyone,3
easy enough for you,3
do it put me out of my misery so i dont have to listen to you whining anymore you think its so easy,3
dont think i wont,3
do it,3
i fucking dont know what do you think we werent burying treasure we didnt pace it out so we could come back and get it we dug a hole and we put her in it your guess is as good as mine,3
where show me where,3
i dont know out there somewhere,3

you cant go to the cops all you can do is cut me loose and walk away because you got nothing,3
where do you think youre taking this huh gonna be a big hero avenge that little girls death gonna make everything right with the world how you gonna do that,3
keep moving,3
show me,3
took it out the bathroom window buried it in the woods,3
what did you do with her body,3
there wasnt nobody around this place was a shithole i backed up the car to the door and we carried her in like groceries dino made her eat a bunch of pills we laid out the plastic put film in the camera and machine went to work,3
nobody saw you bring her in,3
what do you want to know you saw it you saw the loop,3
tell me what happened,3
made me sick but what did i care what did i care if some hump wants to beat off to that it was just something i was doing for money,3
you enjoy it,3
i dont know i felt like it i never saw anyone get done before,3
because were going there,3
why,3
show me where you did it on the map exactly where you did it,3
fuck you then you want to know i talked her up told her how beautiful she was told her she was gonna be a star i told her i was gonna get her a screen test and while im doing that i got her a soda and dropped a mickey when it was dark enough i rang dino and told him it was go time i put her in the trunk of my car and we went and we fucking did it thats what happened shes dead shes been dead a long fucking time nobody fucking cares,3
i want to know i want to know exactly what you did to her,3
what the fuck do you want from me,3
what did you do knock her out shoot her up,3
something like that,3
so you brought dino in and he brought machine and one day a girl walked into your office because you had an ad in the paper for models and she never walked out,3
it was a lot of fucking money,3
thats all thirty each thats all it took for you to murder her,3
thirty thousand each that fucking cocksucker,3
how much did he pay you,3
yeah,3
told him you could get him a snuff film,3
yeah the fucking lawyer,3
okay well come back to that so six years ago a guy contacts you through the classifieds over the phone however he does it its longdale looking for a snuff film and you entrepreneur that you are tell him you can hook him up,3
what the fuck am i gonna protect that freak for he was dinos boy not mine he shows up with his mask on leaves with his mask on nobody knows,3

you killed that girl and you put it on film you and your pals youre fucked you fucked up real good,3
what the fuck are you,3
you murdered that girl eddie six years ago,3
who is this,3
i know what you did,3

i know what you did,3
yeah whos this,3
eddie,3
celebrity films,3
fuck you,3
get together some upscale product where the girls still have teeth in their head till then fuck you,3
look you cocksucker,3
the only thing wrong is the cheap softcore crap youre peddling eddie where do you get this stuff,3
maybe theres something wrong with the scumbag customers coming into your place ever think of that,3
i had three jerkoffs trying to return your tapes last month do you know how bad a skin flick has to be for some jackass to come back into my place with a fucking receipt and try to fucking return it,3
you know how my tapes sell people eat this stuff up,3
look at him you think he played it square how much did he give you how much did he keep for himself,3
hes lying,3
go ahead shoot me then try driving to brooklyn with my brains all over the windshield,3
give me the film,3
youll get it when we get there,3
give me the film,3
fuck you,3
you almost went over your limit,3
because he could he did it because he could what other reason were you looking for,3
enlighten me,3
isnt it incredibly obvious,3
why did he buy a film of some poor lost girl getting butchered,3
a man like mr christian a great man all his money all his power a man who attained everything there was to attain,3
im asking,3
youre asking me why,3
just tell me tell me some more of the secrets you and christian shared what kind of degenerate pervert was he really what the fuck did he want with a snuff film,3
youre making me very angry,3
did it get him off huh watching them cut her up tell me because i really want to understand did he jerk off to it you watch it with him sit there giving him a handjob while you both watched,3
shut your mouth and drive,3
mary anne mathews was alive till you paid money to have her murdered,3
shut up,3
you found these smut dealers and asked to buy a snuff film right wanted them to find you one well they didnt find you one longdale they went out and made you one,3
mary anne mathews that was her name her mom remembers her,3
none of this would be happening if you would have left it alone if you werent digging up a girl who died six years ago a girl no one even remembers,3
except youre willing commit murder with them,3
theyre no friends of mine,3
followed me must have freaked out when you saw me closing in on your buddies,3
never mind how i found you,3
thats why you got scared when mrs christian hired me you knew about the film figured it had to be in that safe howd you find me,3
i was well compensated,3
must have paid you a lot for you to risk everything wouldve had to have cut yourself a real nice piece of money,3
thats trust mr christian trusted me implicitly,3
so he sent you gave you the money his errandboy and if you refused it wasnt like you could tell anyone your pervert boss just asked you to get him a snuff film thats the beauty of lawyerclient privilege,3
wouldnt exactly have been possible for a man of his stature,3
you were the middleman am i right old man christian wasnt about to go shopping for a snuff film himself,3
well whatever reasons mrs christian has for engaging the services of a private investigator i should certainly be a party to but since she feels differently i can only go on the record as having expressed my adamant disapproval,3
thats right,3
you are a private investigator,3
of what sort,3
as mr christians attorney and one of the executors of his estate it concerns me that a meeting of this sort should take place without my being asked to attend,3
im listening,3
yes i do have something to say i insisted on being here as soon as i heard mrs christian contacted you,3
its not my money the woman i got it from is never going to give it a second thought lets not make a big deal out of this okay go be a race car driver go run for president whatever,3
look thats awful generous and everything,3
its money people use it to purchase goods and services,3
whats this,3
nope,3
still dont want to tell me what youre doing,3
im trying to figure that out myself i have to see machine without his mask,3
whats next,3
devil frightened me as much as it excited me but id be hard pressed to choose a favorite,3
i know if i had to pick itd be choke or devil,3
what kind of junior pi would i be if i didnt go with you,3
you dont need to be here,3
nobody knows his name thats his thing he always wears a mask you never see his face he calls himself machine thats what they call him machine,3
who is he his name,3
i told you hes one of dino velvets stock players,3
who is he,3
who is this in the mask who is he,3
wha,3
its cheap and people know to mind their own business what have you got for me,3
oh come on man what are we doing in this flea bag,3
great,3
its their presidential suite,3
you didnt say it was gonna be this luxurious,3
see ya,3
consider it meanwhile dig up whatever dino velvet films you can get receipts ill call back,3
you want me to come out there and play private eye,3
take a vacation ill pay you four hundred a day plus expenses,3
im a working stiff pops,3
well im in new york now what do you say to flying out and giving me a hand,3
he cuts all kinds of other stuff into his movies photographs newsreel footage subliminal images thinks hes making art,3
alright i get the picture,3
nothing illegal its always borderline like if some freak wants to see a transvestite in a full rubber immersion suit getting an enema from a,3
out of the back of bondage magazines mostly but you can find it on the street if you look hell also do commissions for enough money,3
where does he sell it,3
youre learning,3
specialty product,3
films whod have thought it,3
flicks supposed to be a real weirdo,3
good question,3
so you have a wife and kid waiting for you in pennsylvania what are you doing mixed up in all this,3
a daughter,3
i see a ring on your finger you have any kids,3
what about me,3
you cant sit there all day watching the parade of losers that comes into that place without going numb so what am i gonna go off and be a race car driver go to harvard run for president what about you pops,3
youre telling me it doesnt get to you,3
yeah im a real genius what choices have i got fuck just because i know about stuff like tonight doesnt mean i deal it i work a job it beats pumping gas beats making hamburgers,3
you just strike me as smart enough to be doing something else,3
im not mixed up in anything hayseed what are you talking about,3
i dont mean any offense but what are you doing mixed up in all this,3
i dont know where are yours,3
where are your parents,3
twentyfive,3
how old are you,3
first of all basement sales like tonight arent gonna last much longer its too risky one and two everythings going on the internet anyone with a computer and enough patience can find anything he wants its heaven for those degenerate chickenhawks theyre swapping pictures back and forth as fast as their modems can zap em but theres still some weird shit under the counter where i work sometimes no one knows where it comes from thats local underground where information spreads by word of mouth those are zombies hardcore junkies their hands are permanently pruned they go out in the sun they dont burn they blister other than that all i know about is the mail classified ads in the paper with hidden codes secret couriers credit card orders to dummy corporations interstate wire transfers revolving po boxes but if youre asking me who do you go to to get illegal shit who knows thats the whole point the seller stays as far away from the buyer as possible and vice versa and cops cant trace the deal theres ways to do it so nobody knows who anybody is,3
what other ways are there to get illegal films who do you see,3
i heard you asking that guy wasnt yanking you around theres no such thing,3
snuff films,3
child pornography,3
what you saw tonight were not talking about a video some dentist takes home over the weekend were talking about stuff where people get hurt specialty product,3
interesting theory,3
wake up pops your education begins tonight,3
hello,3
see you then oh and dont call me pops,3
tomorrow night i get off at eight,3
heres my number if you need it when can you start,3

four hundred a week off the books,3
how much do you make now,3
how much,3
well theres the thing youre not gonna know anything about what im doing but you can make some money,3

im not a cop,3
youre not a cop are you if i ask and you are you have to tell me,3
well whatever there is whoevers dealing however its done i want to know i want a good look so if youve got that kind of connection great if not speak now,3

thomas welles nice picture,3
i need some information thought you might be able to help,3
remember me,3

wouldnt want to embarrass yourself in front of your fellow perverts,3
i tear off the cover and paste this one on you know how it is,3
truman capote,3
catchy title what are you really reading hard to believe that books got any parts worth highlighting,3
once you pick it up you cant put it down,3
ill risk it,3
well its tempting but no thanks,3
my boss tells me i have to do more suggestive selling,3
pardon me,3

yeah guess so,3
big date tonight,3
if you have a pencil and paper ill tell you how to send it,3

ive got about five thousand left in cash but ill need another thirty if you approve,3
fine,3
ive made progress im in manhattan once a few more pieces fall into place ill drive to you and give you an update,3
nothing more than a bother have you any news for me,3
i hope its nothing serious,3
ive been ordered into bed the doctor says ive gotten the flu or some other wretched ailment,3
i dont know if lucks the word are you feeling alright,3
how are you having any luck,3
mrs christian tom welles here,3
hello,3
youre one hell of a detective mrs christian,3
you told me to look so i looked,3
send it to me through the post office like we arranged no return address you dug this up all by yourself,3
okay,3
for a human life murder on film no statute of limitations who knows it sure could have id like you to overnight me a copy of those checks then put them in a safe deposit box,3
do you think the film could have cost that much,3
im here,3
hello,3
to the penny exactly one million dollars in cash,3
youre joking,3
totalled together these five checks from five different accounts they equal one million dollars,3
okay i follow you so far,3
one was for two hundred thousand one dollar and thirteen cents another was for three hundred thousand six hundred fifty four dollars and seventy six cents,3
the checks were for odd amounts,3
im not positive this means anything,3
my husband never dealt with money personally certainly not cash,3
okay,3
i know what im asking your compensation will be appropriate to the risk youll need cash to buy information and ill provide it i feel responsible mr welles you saw what he did to her,3
nothing remotely like this,3
youve found missing persons before,3
i deal in divorce cases corporate investigations,3
any evidence you collect can be given to the police later anonymously ive thought about it and theres no other way if you cant find them if the only thing that comes from this film is that this is all my husband will be remembered for well i cant let that happen im telling you i wont if theres no chance that poor girls memory can be served then ill just have to spend my last days trying to forget her,3
it wont work like that,3
no for me to live with the ruin of my husbands name i need know that whoever did this will be punished if you can find them i will take their names to the police ill say my husband confessed on his death bed ill say i didnt have courage to come forward at first,3
you dont have any other choice,3
i told you i cant not yet,3
you you need to go to the police,3
of course but im certain its nothing to worry about,3
will you watch it and see for yourself,3
im sure it is its probably something your husband was given as a bad joke more than likely he never even watched it,3
im telling you its not that,3
if you were to study it youd see the camera cutting away youd see the tricks they can play,3
no,3
mrs christian please will you sit down a moment i want you to listen carefully what youre talking about is a snuff film but from what i know snuff films are a kind of urban myth like red light district folklore theres no such thing i can assure you,3
i didnt know what to think i cant tell you how horrible its been to know this belonged to my husband to know that he watched this this atrocity but i cant go to the police,3
this is a movie showing a girl being murdered shes sitting on a bed and a man rapes her and he begins to cut her with a knife i only watched what i could,3
im afraid i dont,3
its a film of a girl being murdered,3
cash stock certificates and this,3
do you want to tell me what you found,3
there was nothing he could do my husband left everything to me i prevented anyone from seeing the contents i felt these were my husbands private things i didnt i didnt realize,3
you hired someone to open it ill bet the lawyer loved that,3
my husband was the only one with the combination to this safe i knew about it but as far as i was concerned it was none of my business not till now that is,3
just curious,3
i wear a gun when i can tell a client expects me to other than that theres never any reason,3
do you carry a gun mr welles,3
we were married fortyfive years hard even for me to imagine we had our troubles there were plenty of places for him to be other than here but he was always loyal to me and i to him i loved him deeply,3
he succeeded,3
mostly thats where he started his empire building he was a good man notorious as an eccentric but that was something he cultivated he wanted to be legendary,3
pittsburgh,3
ill do whatever i can to help,3
his passing has left me with something of a dilemma a terrible terrible dilemma,3
my condolences,3
as you know my husband passed away recently two weeks ago now,3
you are highly recommended praised for your discretion your strict adherence to confidentiality,3
ive been privileged to provide services for people i admire,3
ive spoken to friends of mine and my husbands in harrisburg in lancaster and hershey asking about you i must say you have friends in influential places,3
hes a lawyer please sit here,3
hes odd,3
thank you,3
have a pleasant evening will you have tea mister welles,3
apparently mr longdale has something he feels he simply must say before you and i speak,3
uh huh pleasure,3
i try to be,3
mister welles youre very prompt,3
they murdered her mrs mathews im sorry it happened a month after she ran away shes been dead all this time,3
why why are you doing this to me,3
they killed her and they took her out in the forest somewhere and they buried her,3
no no no,3
he raped her andandand he murdered herhe cut her up with knifes,3
no,3
they brought her into the room one man he put a knife to her throat and he raped her,3
who are you,3
someone some men they took your daughter and they drugged her and they took her to a motel room they did terrible things to her,3
who is this,3
mrs mathews your daughter is dead shes dead,3
what,3
she went to california to los angeles she wanted to start over she wanted to be an actress,3
what are you talking about,3
i have to tell you something it wont be easy for you to hear its about your daughter mary anne when i when i was there with you her diary in your attic in silverware if you read it youll know what im telling you is true,3
i remember you just left,3
mrs mathews its thomas do you remember i was there a few weeks ago asking about your daughter,3
hello,3
what am i supposed to do forget her time heals all wounds right shes all i think about and ive learned to live with that but you want the truth the real truth if i had a choice if i had to choose between her being out there living a good life and being happy and me not knowing never finding out what happened to her or her being dead and me knowing id choose to know,3
its been six years,3
i think about it everyday but every time the phone rings every single time i still think its her,3
yes,3
you were right i didnt find anything im going to run and get something to eat are you hungry,3
youre probably right and i probably wont find anything i dont have a right to ask this and you can kick me out of your house if you want but this is my profession and theres a part of me that cant let it go police are just as human as you or i they could have missed something they probably didnt wouldnt you rather know,3
my husband never laid a hand on her she would have told me she would have told me,3
will you let me look,3
how how can you say that to me,3
if the police focused their search in her room her belongings well thatd be only natural but they may have been looking in the wrong place,3
no you dont have any reason to think that,3
it is possible and i know this isnt something you want to hear your daughter may have tried to hide a note where she thought you would eventually find it but where she knew your husband would never find it she might have wanted to tell you something,3
i dont know i think so,3
do you think the police did a good job,3
there wasnt one the police looked,3
its not really my place but its not easy for me to set aside the private detective part of me either see i know a little about missing persons when kids run they almost always leave a note its guilt they want to say goodbye,3
what,3
ive got what i need for my report there is there is one thing that bothers me though,3
you should be,3
no,3
are you religious,3
were all like that,3
doesnt make much sense does it when everythings happy when lifes fine and you have every reason to believe theres a god you dont bother then something horrible happens thats when you start praying all the time thats when you start going to church,3
okay,3
i i shouldnt take anymore of your time maybe we can finish tomorrow ill call tomorrow,3
of course,3
people remember me from the news can you drive me back now,3
no one knows what its like you cant even imagine how much it hurts,3
i had to ask i apologize,3
you try going through what we did bob couldnt take it thats all christ theres times when it still seems like i cant either,3
i didnt mean to,3
there wasnt anything like that the police and the fbi people asked but there wasnt anything happened like that never my husband his heart broke when mary left,3
you have to forgive me but in these circumstances with your daughter were there any indications of any sort of abuse,3
it got to be too much for him,3
why do you think he did it,3
we were divorced by then things fell apart he was living with a friend,3
september 4th 1993 about a year after mary disappeared,3
yes,3
if theres anything you feel uncomfortable talking about tell me but i have to ask your husband he committed suicide,3
i dont know,3
what was she running from,3
she didnt seem herself for months there never was any way to get her to talk about it one night we went to bed the next morning she was gone she took some clothes,3
she just seemed depressed,3
no,3
so she didnt leave a note she never gave any indication where she might go before she left,3
you probably expect me to be wearing a trench coat and a hat drinking whiskey chasing women and getting beaten up by guys with broken noses want to know what its really like its sitting in a car and staring at a hotel window for three days straight pissing in a plastic bottle pardon me because some guy thinks his wifes cheating on him glamorous huh and the guy who hired you he has a hairlip dandruff and crooked teeth and you could have told him the minute you laid eyes on him his wifes cheating and you dont blame her,3
i didnt think there were private detectives anymore except on tv,3
thats exactly what i am,3
they hired you youre like a private detective,3
its very important you dont let this raise your expectations its not going to effect any ongoing efforts all im saying is please know im not here to create any false hope,3
well im following up on your daughter mary height five four weight hundred ten pounds brown eyes blonde hair born april 24 1976 missing june 11th 1992 a runaway thats how shes listed is this information correct,3
no,3
right agent cole told me hed call and let you know to expect me he didnt call,3
neil neil cole,3
what was the name ive got it here somewhere,3
these volunteer organizations are sort of interconnected functioning hand in hand with law enforcement the rcmp brought me in to review their investigations factcheck their records see if theres anything they missed anything they should be doing different im here for a few days before i head back up to virginia these reports go to the justice department eventually i spoke to your fbi contact a few days ago uh,3
yes but,3
im sorry let me explain the rcmp is a support organization and archive not unlike the center for missing and exploited children in washington im sure youve dealt with them before,3
i dont understand who are,3
ive been hired as an independent contractor by the us resource center for missing persons as part of an internal audit if you have any time over the next few days id like to make an appointment to ask some questions about the disappearance of your daughter,3
hello mrs mathews my names thomas jones im a state licensed investigator,3

hes going after debbie i gotta stop him,3
who,3
try what other kids did keep each other awake well meet at debbies tonight at least if we dont sleep he cant get us,3
then what else can we do,3
yeah right lets trade death by freddy for life in a rubber room adults wont see it they cant,3
why cant we just talk to the authorities,3
you dont really get it hes not a nightstalker itll take more than bench presses to beat him,3
i dont think so i guess this is my own war,3
is there something we can do,3
not really,3
kristen was the last child left of the people who killed freddy maybe freddy cant get to new kids without someone like me someone to bring them to him,3
alright lets assume this whole thing is true why does freddy all of a sudden need you,3
three days,3
how long have you been awake,3
the story is the deaths you cant argue with,3
no offense or anything but its kind of hard to swallow,3
look you know why you just dont believe me,3
extra money huh,3
ive been working double shifts,3
kristens story really got to her,3
no dont i gave sheila to him and now shes dead,3
in her dream,3
i was there in the dream he took her it was awful it was awful,3
it was no suicide it was not an accident it was freddy and hes coming back for seconds thirds and fourths,3
i thought it was an accident smoking in bed,3
i know uhalice,3
tell him i was looking for him okay im dan,3
rick stayed later after school with kristen she wasnt feeling very well,3
youre his sister right,3

enough of that crap,3
it was freddy,3
asthma attackwhat 17year old has a fatal asthma attack she was gonna be a doctor,3
give her time beauty is skin deep,3
i think sheilas more interested in dissecting bodies than just admiring them,3
alright i think i see salvation,3
rick please,3
what else you ever look over this towns history not a safe place to be a teenager anyway if im next watch your back,3
about freddy,3
shes blaming herself for sheila i know how it feels ive been thinking about kristen maybe i couldve stopped it if id listened,3
how she doing i ran into her last night,3

why dont i go make some coffee theres a lot to tell,3
tell me some more about this krueger guy,3
it wasnt her mother the only reason were still here is that none of us has slept since the grad party,3
maybe it was her mother who killed her with all that polly perfect shit,3
nobody thinks that,3
do you think im an idiotfor being in love with her,3
mark,3
then get out,3
she mustve fallen asleep at the table,3

i want to talk to both you guys about greta and,3
yeah im just aces,3
mark are you okay,3
thats why its my fault dans dead,3

i dont believe this all that gore you paint in the comics and youre squeamish,3
oh man i couldve gone all night without looking at that,3

next life oh whats that,3
yeah when are you gonna come to your senses,3
all of us right,3
bottom line alice anybody supernatural or not that wants to hurt you hell have to go through us first,3
pushy parents can make you more than a bit crazy,3
look dans parents were pushing him pushing him hard he was bitching about it at the party last night he was under pressure we all are,3
i want to talk about the baby,3
stop saying that its bullshit,3
nah its getting too cold for me and my wonderful mother will kill me if i screw up my hair shes got some model agency guy coming to dinner tomorrow night,3
naah im done got to be on shift in a couple hours arent you going in,3
have another one sounds like you need it,3
that means theyre gonna give me the key to the pool so i can lock up when im done,3
yeah,3
all right kids i tell you what were gonna do ive got swimming practice until sixthirty today,3
makes you look like a nun,3
these things are wild what do you think,3
he invited me to his house last night,3
you too,3
stick around please,3
its okay,3
i cant listen to this,3
im not finished i loved greta a lot and if maybe just maybe someone or some thing killed her id like to hear about it,3
mark,3
why dont you shut up and let her talk two of us died in the last two days does that strike you as particularly normal,3
faint,3
vomit,3
two hours a day six days a week,3
dan and hes taking alice with him pretty good dive yvonne youve been practicing,3
and his egghead son well give em a uroughu ureceptionu wont we,3
i wouldnt worry so long as we have boats like the tiger shark and people like you the skipper dave kent sir ian and my father,3
i dont know,3
but if they udou,3
maybe just maybe when their ship doesnt return theyll decide not to come here after all,3
which is the one we have to worry about,3
yes,3
theyre so remote cold beautiful the stars but now i wonder,3
id sooner swim,3
however our ideas disagree as ive said before im unotu a coward and it happens youve got no choice either uiu take you down there in the lungfish or you dont get there,3
any more than being the son of captain neilsen does,3
thats enough holloway ive told you before wearing boards on your shoulders and parading with a stiff spine doesnt auto matically endow you with back bone,3
thenthis is a flying saucer,3
unidentified flying objects,3
you may not uwinu them but without men like your father to degrade himself by fighting to preserve them or as much as we have of them theyd have disappeared ulongu ago,3
peace the dignity of man the destiny of the human spirit show me a man who says you win uthoseu by fighting wars and uillu show you an idiot,3
you mean unothingu is worth fighting for,3
perhaps but the idea of willingly going to uschoolu to spend my ulifeu at a paleozoic pastime that should have disappeared with the thunderlizards im referring to war uthatu strikes me as the uworstu cowardice of all being spiritually yellow,3
youre really a mixedup oddball arent you,3
that may be but dad stays where uheu is and im staying here,3
were uallu risking our lives,3
wearing a uniform doesnt bestow an automatic monopoly on courage ucommanderu it just so happens im unotu a coward physical or mental and before id risk my fathers life,3
uyouu said it but i wont argue,3
you trade school boys are all alike arent you anybody who doesnt happen to think like a little goldbraided puppet is ipso facto a coward,3
your father can be in nome alaska tomorrow we have two choices ask them to send him out in a copter and take you off or the shark can put back into nome,3
what did you mean im out,3
dead matter of fact hes much better hes left the hospital,3
my father hes not,3
your out this came for you,3
what is it,3
not in two days look do you think i uwantedu to come if it didnt mean so much to dad proving his depthexplorer its the last thing id want,3
you could train someone else,3
and they thought uyouu could re place the skipper,3
it was moderate hell be all right but it was out of the question his coming along,3
how is he,3
it was supposed to be dad had a heart attack two days ago,3
i should have suspectcd when i heard that doctor i thought it was your father,3
whats goin on in here lad what,3
dave,3
oh it does,3
here keep these it wants me to come alone,3
im with uyouu,3
well,3
well have to look for them later,3
wonder where powell and carney are,3
somewhere down there,3
where do you think the voice you heard was coming from,3
the sound again,3
you hear that,3
lets get back to work and maybe we uwillu be soon,3
and if i didnt uknowu better id swear we were moving,3
you know it uisu,3
hey you know somethin its getting lighter in here,3
strange you didnt hear it omit 274f,3
i dont hear anything maybe youve been down here too long why dont you go back up and,3
listen hear that,3
yeah,3
go back and tell dr neilsen have him report to the skipper,3
i think youre right,3
whats more important theres our problem the bow ram the sawteeth are holding the shark in the break if we can cut the ram the shark can pull herself loose,3
how about that the bow drove half through her but she sealed herself right up,3
not ualoneu youre not,3
you all wait here im going inside take a look,3
reef and i can take the explorer down clamp it around the eye and,3
us,3
youve got to let us try skipper,3
skipper look at the depth gauge,3
were stuck tight,3
sounds like it distress call from a small freighter between ellesmere island and greenland one mayday thennothing,3
cyclops,3
his side ive seen it all right a nice bright yellow,3
have you ever talked to carl tried to see his side,3
but utheyreu not skipper neilsens son it broke his heart then when some newspapers called carl the honest sincere son of a warmongering father captain neilsen resigned from the navy oh he still keeps his hand in playing around with projects like the lungfish but it broke him all the same,3
a lot of people think like that,3
so all of a sudden his only son drops out of school be gins making noises like a pacifist a real egghead dogooder and crackpot ban the atom tests junk the nuclear subs spend the mili tary budgetfor peace,3
so,3
one of the finest men and officers alive a real hero in the best sense of the word in world war two he taught us engineering and design fought like a demon to develop atom subs,3
i guess,3
i guess skipper neilsen re tired before you enrolled at the academy didnt he,3
i might have a son like uthatu,3
huh,3
youve asked why i stay a bachelor there goes the best reason i know,3
disappointing a ubigu girl,3
what could be worse than disappoint ing a little girl,3
uthatsu the worst possible moment,3
at the worst possible moment tomorrow is janies birthday poor little kid has looked forward for two months to having her daddy home now,3
so they caught up with you too,3
reef,3
helen i appeal to you,3
but julies a nice girl and ive seen you work she deserves a fighting chance,3
now dave old buddy you know youre exaggerating what do you think of this husband of yours on most boats a certain loyalty exists between the exec and his navigation and firing officer but unfortunately in the case of lieutenant dave milburn of the tiger shark and myself,3
we hope,3
sidearms but the saucers dead,3
with their underwater experience theyll be invaluable take sidearms and flare pistols,3
the frogmen,3
you better take powell and carney with you,3
right at our oneeyed friend,3
what course skipper,3
what,3
a mass of jellylike stuff came out of the thing and caught our torpedo,3
speedabout twentytwo knots coursedue north,3
course and speed,3
idont know,3
what about down,3
seems to be all around,3
is there any way out of it,3
right skipper,3
get ready we shove off as soon as griff reports all the crew aboard,3
what,3
were dead in the water but it indicates were moving,3
why do you say that,3
the inertial navigation system must have been knocked out in the crash,3
something wrong,3
skipper could you take a look here,3
all internal repairs completed and frogmen report exterior damage minor,3
yes griff,3
excuse me skipper,3
what about time,3
its possible i could adapt one of the torpedo guidance systems to the icbm so it would home on the saucer when he rises from the pole,3
anything,3
excuse me captain there may be one last desperate chance a oneinathousand shot,3
radiation levelconstantly rising,3
now they feel itdown below,3
thats wonderful carl reef thinks they can clear the shark bow so we can pull ourself loose,3
wonderful,3
we read you go ahead doctor theyre inside the saucer its filled with breathable air,3
as ready as we ucanu be ill report to the skipper,3
all ready,3
there is i believe our friendcyclops is returning to life,3
theres got to be an explanation,3
as we near the pole,3
what direction does the system indicate,3
the radiation level from the saucer its rising,3
if we were lucky enough to catch him with his power depleted,3
in such a way as to prevent his returning to it and as you put it recharging his batteries,3
the north pole is the positive end of the biggest magnet of all the earth itself,3
uweu harness energy on a small scale by cutting magnetic lines of force maybe cyclops does it on a usuperu scale,3
we took for granted his source of energy was nuclear but suppose it isnt at all what if its umagneticu,3
what if the tiger shark were to anticipate a bit perhaps be lying there waiting,3
suppose our theorizing is correct then this ucouldu be the next danger point,3
above murmansk and finland,3
highintensity arcs will burn submerged and millions of voltsdischarged in random directions,3
under uwateru,3
it doesnt seem possible but could it be an electrical storm center,3
minus three,3
whats the corrected bearing to the magnetic pole,3
nothing we can do now,3
straight to the pole at almost fifty knots,3
if we could get inside the saucer use our torches maybe we could cut the shark loose,3
what,3
suppose theres an atmosphere of some kind inside cyclops,3
and were at safe maximum depth already stop engines,3
its the screws skipper at our declination angle running in reverse theyre pulling the shark uandu cyclops right to the bottom,3
a hundred and eighty fathoms we cant be sinking that fast,3
we can uramu him,3
but what can we accomplish,3
thats what i said,3
right uatu him,3
thirtyfour seconds,3
whats the running time,3
take a look,3
youre sure its cyclops,3
after torpedo room report,3
determine extent of damage immediately,3
i think i should have joined the air force,3
what do you think,3
itll be all right were old friends,3
huh,3
doctor neilsen when did uthatu happen,3
dr neilsen hell be,3
who with,3
im afraid i have some bad news for you reef youll have to share quarters this trip,3
i met dr kent once,3
i did go just back reef these are a couple of our passengers sir ian hunt and dr clifford kent my exec commander richard holloway,3
thought you were going to washington skipper,3
uthatu might be a ulittleu uroughu,3
obviously,3
to navigate wont you have to see your way,3
of course but it is time to be gin the return voyage,3
thats why no water leaked inside when we rammed you,3
it is a living thing when damaged you would say wounded it immediately heals itself,3
i have selected you to return with me along with several other specimens for study we will examine you and the others discover desirable features to incorporate in our earthcolonizers,3
why,3
on the contrary i want you unharmed perfect,3
why not me what am i the closing act,3
i am afraid not therefore,3
he did,3
your friend was to remain where he was,3
swell,3
for horrors like yourself,3
my mission is to study various solar systems and planets select the most suitable for colonization,3
tell me something why can uiu hear you when the others couldnt,3
point of view is everything to us uyouru form of life is ugly as we appear to you,3
thats a ufaceu,3
come where,3
remove your weapons commander and come here alone,3
all right go to it,3
cyclops will have to linger at the pole to recharge his power banks,3
toward the pole,3
due north at five knotsno six,3
but uanswersu are what we need not more questions,3
weve asked ourselves that over and over a thousand times,3
or perhaps until he gets us,3
you plotted the course of cyclops then thats uouru course wherever uheu goes uweu gountil we get him,3
our cyclops throws quite a thunderbolt itself,3
just musing about our oneeyed adversary and the legend of homer cyclopes were the sons of heaven who forged the thunder bolts thrown by zeus,3
ill be another,3
well ill be,3
the pattern each incident occurred almost precisely a thousand statute miles from the pole a line through the points of occurrence makes almost a complete circle,3
see what,3
thank you,3
my yeoman will show you to your quarters,3
all the figures show is that gordon lariviere is going to be a very rich man using his position as selectman in a year or two you wont recognize this town,3

hard to say if we go for custody depositions psychiatric evaluations it could drag on ten or twelve thousand dollars she could win on appeal if we just want to get the visitation rights redrawn assuming theyre unduly restrictive it wouldnt be more than twentyfive hundred,3

what is it anna,3
ninotchka i wouldnt bring this up if we werent such good friends,3
you feel it though,3
they must have wonderful materials to make a thing like this so soft something you dont even see,3
well sometimes theyre not completely covered but they dont freeze,3
and there,3
no my dear it is true thats how they live in the other world here we dress to have our bodies covered to keep warm,3
now ninotchka youre exaggerating,3
yes,3
you mean to tell me you wear a different dress for different times of the day,3
when you get up you put on a negligee and then you change to a morning frock,3
what do you wear in the morning,3
a dress you wear in the evening,3
evening gown,3
an evening gown,3
as beautiful as that what else come tell me,3
it was very silly i would be ashamed to wear it here,3
what was it like,3
well a hat,3
tell me what else did you have,3
no i left everything in paris i just happened to be wearing this,3
ninotchka you know i am your friend you can trust me did you bring back anything else,3
thank you anna ill dry it up here when i wash it next i should hate to see our country endangered by my underwear,3
you know how it is today all you have to do is wear a pair of silk stockings and they suspect you of counterrevolution,3
i see,3
when i passed through the laundry yard today i saw all the women huddled around this so i brought it up here things like this create a bad feeling first they didnt know whose it was then they saw the paris label and did it start a commotion some said its what we all ought to wear and others said its like hanging foreign ideas on our clothesline it undermines our whole cause,3
you should ill show you,3
i have nothing to hide,3
thats just it it makes people feel queer i dont want you to get in any trouble,3
i havent talked to anyone about paris i havent said a word,3
ever since you have been back from paris,3
about what,3
and you too ninotchka,3
you should be more careful anna,3
ill tell you later that gurganov you never know whether hes on his way to the washroom or the secret police,3
it just goes to prove the theory of our state if you stand alone it means a boiled egg but if youre true to the collective spirit and stick together youve got an omelet that reminds me have you heard the latest theyre telling about the kremlin,3
well ive saved up two eggs and each of my friends is bringing his own so well manage,3
an omelet arent you living a little above your ration,3
an omelet,3
what are you serving,3
a few friends just a little dinner party,3
i know my heart is sad but my feet are happy when all the tanks and guns were roaring over the red square i sat here all by myself and played a beethoven sonata not bad at all are you expecting someone,3
too bad you missed an inspiring day anna,3
they didnt let me i am in disgrace last week at the performance of carmen i played a sour note the conductor got so excited he yelled theres sabotage in the string section,3
no the opera starts an hour later tonight on account of the parade,3
arent you late,3
good evening ninotchka,3
good evening anna,3
right now its on the balcony,3
it may step out of a bazaar it may wait for you in a corridor it may hide in the shadow of a minaret,3
imagine we dont have to whisper any longer,3
we are not comrades any more we are friends ninotchka,3
i know but if we cant put in all these wonderful things at least lets put in some imagination in that one omelet well taste the whole of paris,3
and the surprise is theres nothing in it,3
des raisins de mad???re des framboises,3
lets fill it with confitures des prunes,3
i should be a swallow right now i would be sitting in front of the caf??? de paris picking up flakes of french pastry that would melt in my bill,3
if you asked him why he left france i bet he couldnt name one good reason,3
it is ninotchka it is he must have been in paris you can see it in his whole attitude he just picked up a crumb of our black bread shook his head and dropped it,3
thats another thing its spring,3
can you blame them at least the may day parade is over,3
how nicely youve fixed the table ninotchka,3
a little more tact look how nicely shes fixed the table all for us,3
i can tell you exactly,3
if you hadnt given commissar razinin such a wonderful report about us who knows what would have happened,3
thats right,3
imagine for once in our lives we were in paris and we never went to the eiffel tower,3
or we cant go back to russia,3
or it might be the firing squad,3
you must help us leon if you dont win her over were on our way to siberia,3
once in petersburg i was driving down the nevsky prospect in my cart and her highness in her troika swept down from the opposite direction and when i couldnt make way quick enough she spat in my face,3
imagine the niece of the czar opening the door for us,3
thats her,3
positively not,3
no thats not him,3
possibly,3
are we free buljanoff,3
and little lady beatrice,3
and how is lord lavenham,3
hes a bad man sends people to siberia,3
you wouldnt like razinin,3
all right lets uphold it for another ten minutes,3
comrades comrades dont lets give in so quickly after all we have to uphold the prestige of russia,3
i dont want to go to siberia,3
are you the buljanoff who fought on the barricades and now you are afraid to take a room with a bath,3
no thats bad management,3
we can say whatever we want we can shout we can complain look the service in this hotel is terrible see nobody comes nobody pays any attention thats freedom,3
lets forget the future lets stop being sentimental lets start that omelet,3
and if it is too late for you your children will eat it,3
just see how happy the people look from here,3
shes right anyhow lets talk ourselves into it,3
how many families live here with you,3
what a lovely room you have here,3
and thats something we owe to ninotchka,3
lets be happy that were all alive,3
thats right and we might as well face it,3
you know what they say theres nothing like home,3
leon how would you like to have three lifelong friends,3
yes we could stay with leon,3
what do you mean they might they will,3
and they might believe her in moscow,3
and leonitchka what she said about us,3
for ourselves we are much happier now since we moved to a little room next to the servants quarters,3
we had to take it on account of the safe,3
yes he looks like a comrade,3
that must be the one,3
a telegram from moscow it must have been here all day,3
what is it,3
misha misha,3
we like you leon dont we like leon,3
we dont like razinin,3
but what can we do we have to accept,3
hes cutting our throat,3
they accumulate millions by taking loss after loss,3
capitalistic methods,3
well just say we had to take it on account of the safe thats a perfect excuse there was no other safe big enough,3
now comrades i warn you if it gets out in moscow that we stay in the royal suite we will get into terrible trouble,3
where is your courage comrade buljanoff,3
just a minute just a minute i have nothing against the idea but i still say lets go back to the hotel terminus moscow made our reservations there we are on an official mission and we have no right to change the orders of our superior,3
why should you be afraid,3
well gentlemen im afraid our rates are rather high,3
may i ask how much your rooms are,3
monsieur,3
i am comrade buljanoff,3
no no,3
is there anything i can do for you monsieur,3

we can call our ambassador,3
these may have been the jewels of the duchess swana but like all private property they were confiscated by the state,3
you know monsieur mercier this is all nonsense,3
do we give the impression of people who are pressed for money,3
we can wait,3
he wouldnt say that what he would say is buljanoff you cant afford to live in a cheap hotel doesnt the prestige of the bolsheviks mean anything to you do you want to live in a hotel where you press for the hot water and cold water comes and when you press for the cold water nothing comes out at all phooey buljanoff,3
if lenin were alive he would say buljanoff comrade for once in your life youre in paris dont be a fool go in there and ring three times,3
i dont want to go to the hotel terminus,3
comrades if we ring nine times lets go in,3
they tell me when you ring once the valet comes in when you ring twice you get the waiter and do you know what happens when you ring three times a maid comes in a french maid,3
lets be honest have we anything like it in russia,3
comrades why should we lie to each other its wonderful,3
no no,3
you found your way to us and we werent easy to reach were we,3

yes monsieur,3
a special envoy is coming from moscow hell occupy the royal suite move our things to the smallest room youve got,3
but gentlemen i am afraid,3

im afraid we have no boxes of that size in our vault but there is one suite with a private safe,3
oh yes but have you a safe here big enough to hold this,3
i might be able to accommodate you is there some more luggage,3
monsieur,3
this is comrade kopalski,3
just looking around,3
yes monsieur,3

she doesnt leave her room she has been locked in for the last two days with lawyers and law books,3
well boys id like to help you but what can i do yesterday i waited six hours in the lobby,3

how does this strike you commissar razinin board of trade moscow unexpected situation here duchess swana in paris claims jewels and has already brought injunction against sale or removal after long and careful study we suggest in the interest of our beloved country a fiftyfifty settlement as best solution iranoff buljanoff and kopalski,3
all right go ahead you talk to the lawyer and ill talk to the judge,3
we havent anything to discuss with you well talk to a lawyer,3
yes a very slim one i want to be fair i dont deny that you might make out some kind of a case,3
we may have a chance,3
just a moment i hope you havent closed this deal monsieur mercier it might bring you into serious difficulties,3
now monsieur you have no right,3
dont make it difficult for me this is no more a pleasure trip for me than it is for you,3
and kopalski,3
we will get that well get everything maybe a little bit later but well get it we must be patient finally we got the spring didnt we we got the swallows and you will get your apfel strudel too,3
yes a good piece of apfel strudel,3
now comrades there is something better in life than crumbs of french pastry,3
even the swallows are back,3
the same spring we had in paris just as good,3
and its great think what it was a few years ago and what it is now,3
yes theres no doubt of that just look out of the window and there it is,3
sssh once and for all were in moscow,3
and your own gas cooker thats marvelous naturally its not the royal suite,3
well were back home,3
how are you you three scoundrels,3
no not a thing would you like to go out,3
if there is anything we can do for you,3
oh yes power and light thank you,3
i acted on your suggestion and got in touch with the power and light authorities whenever you want to visit their plants they are open to you,3
you comrade iranoff go to the public library and get me the section of the civil code on property,3
yes comrade,3
we cannot feed the russian people on your intentions fifty per cent to a socalled duchess half of every loaf of bread to our enemy comrade kopalski go at once to our embassy and get the address of the best lawyer in paris,3
we did it with the best intentions,3
will you send me some cigarettes please comrades i am not in a position to pass final judgment but at best you have been careless in your duty to the state you were entrusted with more than a mere sale of jewelry why are we peddling our precious possessions to the world at this time our next years crop is in danger and you know it unless we can get foreign currency to buy tractors there will not be enough bread for our people and you three comrades,3
i will not repeat your mistake i will have no dealings with the grand duchess nor her representative,3
we dealt directly with the representative of the grand duchess i am sure if we call him he will give you a very clear picture,3
i hope so for your sake let us examine the case what does the lawyer say,3
we did our best comrade,3
i am ashamed to put the picture of lenin in a room like this comrades your telegram was received with great disfavor in moscow,3
its a hat comrade a womans hat,3
whats that,3
no thank you,3
allow me comrade,3
why why should you carry other peoples bags,3
he is a porter he wants to carry them,3

if we had known we would have greeted you with flowers,3
au revoir,3
well leave these papers here for your further consideration au revoir madame,3
well theres nothing we can do about it why get excited,3
yes it is unfortunate,3

im sorry gentlemen the other day i heard such a funny story it still makes me laugh it is very funny i am sorry oh yes about this injunction,3
im sorry sir but i must insist,3
you want me to go in there,3
she has been asked to leave the powder room but without success we would appreciate if you would see to it yourself,3
what can i do about it,3
that kind of propaganda is bad anywhere but inciting the attendants of a powder room to go on strike well if she succeeds the consequences will be disastrous,3
give me another double brandy,3
suspicions nothing but suspicions thats the trouble with you if you dont let me in ill stand in front of this office of yours and warn people to keep away from russia ill picket your whole country,3
or a tunnel or a bridge,3
what for why,3
how do i know you dont want to blow up a factory,3
on what,3
why should i take a chance,3
now look here you advertise all over the world that you want people to go into your country and when someone tries to get in you keep him out,3
youre going to force us huh,3
thats impossible nobody has the right you cant do that if you dont give me that visa,3

a funny story,3
quickly please tell me one of your funny stories,3
and general savitzky,3
how do you do,3
there have been cases but the headache the next morning is worth while if you drink it with the right toast to us ninotchka,3
from what i read i thought champagne was a strong drink its very delicate do people ever get drunk on this,3
from goats to grapes thats drinking in the right direction,3
its funny to look back i was brought up on goats milk i had a ration of vodka in the army and now champagne,3
its always good luck to launch something with champagne a battleship or an evening,3
i wouldnt know the closest i ever came to champagne was in a newsreel the wife of some president was throwing it at a battleship,3
my darling,3
leon dont ever ask me for a picture of myself i couldnt bear the thought of being shut up in a drawer i couldnt breathe i couldnt stand it,3
ninotchka youre jealous,3
i suppose she is very entertaining it must be lots of fun to be with her so witty so glamorous,3
ninotchka i love you,3
she is very attractive she has great elegance shes what you call a woman of the world isnt she,3
when i was here before i noticed a photograph of a woman on the desk in a wide silver frame i thought what a waste of silver thats all that interested me then now i would like to know what happened to the woman,3
i dont think so,3
did you make any change in this room,3
i promise i swear,3
if you dont want to answer you neednt but if you do you must tell me the truth,3
anything ninotchka,3
leon i would like to ask you something,3
leon i want to tell you something which i thought i never would say which i thought nobody ever should say because i thought it didnt exist and leon i cant say it,3
no go on,3
leon you know the jokes you told me a few days ago i wake up in the middle of the night and laugh at them now leon thats wrong i know theyre not funny theyre silly theyre stupid and still i laugh and when i look at buljanoff and iranoff and kopalski i know they are scoundrels and i should hate them then i realize who made them like that and instead of sending my report to moscow i tear it up and go down and buy a ridiculous hat and if this keeps on am i too talkative,3
you see i couldnt shout that,3
not radio lets have music thats just for ourselves,3
a wonderful idea radio or records,3
well first i should like to take off my hat and jacket then could we have some music,3
thats when one half of paris says to the other half what are your plans for this evening madame,3
its nine oclock,3
twelve seventyfive from the clarence the sonofagun made a detour but he got you here,3
for twelve francs seventyfive,3
you see life can be so simple,3
ive never been here before i wonder whom youre thinking of oh i know a girl with a map figuring out each step worrying about north and south today now this might shock you i went up to a taxi and said eight rue du bois and here i am,3
you remember this room,3
foolish if this dress were to walk down the boulevard all by itself i would follow it from one end of paris to the other and when i caught up with it i would say just a moment you charming little dress i want you to meet ninotchka you two were meant for each other ninotchka feels more comfortable,3
i dont look too foolish,3
well so far it isnt funny but wait he says to the waiter waiter bring me a cup of coffee so the waiter comes back five minutes later and says im sorry sir we have no coffee wait a minute wait a minute im all mixed up a man comes in a restaurant he sits down he calls the waiter and he says waiter get me a cup of coffee without cream and five minutes later the waiter comes back and says im sorry sir we have no cream can it be a glass of milk,3
yes,3
he sits down at the table and says to the waiter did you get that too,3
yes,3
ill tell you that joke again a man comes into a restaurant did you get that,3
so you dont think thats funny it is funny everyone else thinks so maybe you didnt get it,3
no,3
not funny huh,3
maybe you havent any sense of humor well ill give you one more chance now listen,3
i dont think so,3
it seemed funny to me when i first heard it maybe the trouble isnt with the joke maybe its with you,3
no,3
i suppose you dont think thats funny,3
so do i now heres a great one ha ha ha well maybe its not so good lets forget it hows this two men are looking at the moon one says to the other is it true that a lot of people live on the moon yes it is says the other five hundred million whew replies the first they must get pretty crowded when its half moon ha ha ha,3
i wish they had never met,3
two scotchmen met on the street and i dont know the name of the street and it really doesnt matter well anyway ones name was mcintosh and the others was mcgillicuddy mcintosh says to mcgillicuddy hello mr mcgillicuddy and mcgillicuddy says to mcintosh hello mr mcintosh and then mcintosh says to mcgillicuddy how is mrs mcgillicuddy and then mcgillicuddy says to mcintosh how is mrs mcintosh,3
i have never heard one,3
do you like scotch stories,3
probably not,3
well er lets drop it i dont think you would care for that one,3
on which boat,3
thats not a laugh i mean a laugh from the heart now lets see im going to tell you a funny story just a moment ive got it well it seems there were a couple of frenchmen who went to america,3
ha ha now go back,3
no i cant leave you i wont not yet not until ive made you laugh at least once,3
then you should go back to your table,3
because we are an odd couple,3
why,3
at anything at the whole ludicrous spectacle of life at people being pompous and taking themselves seriously and exaggerating their own importance if you cant find anything else to laugh at you can laugh at you and me,3
at what,3
just smile,3
why,3
will you smile,3
what,3
death death always so glum what about life ninotchka do russians never think of life of the moment in which we are living the only moment we really have dont take it all so seriously ninotchka nothing is worth it please relax i beg you sergeant smile,3
but you have now and i know now that you are a man who employs business methods which in russia would be punished by death,3
oh ninotchka who wants to talk business if you win the suit fine if we win the suit better you do me an injustice when we went to my apartment did i have the slightest idea that you had any connection with this deal,3
your tactics are useless my name is neither buljanoff iranoff nor kopalski,3
must one always be after something,3
what are you after,3
just an old man his memory is getting weak,3
but my dear child i am most at home among working men i hate the places where you circulate the hotel clarence this is my natural element after all what are any of us workingmen at least those of us who are worth our salt hyah,3
this is a place for workmen,3
i always eat here,3
then how did you get here,3
i didnt follow you,3
i dont like your following me,3
pardon me for addressing you but you insulted him you know that you hurt his feelings it was just like telling a musician you dont like music that good old man believes in food as you believe in karl marx you cant go around hurting people comrade yakushova but maybe you can make it up to him do you know how by eating everything with relish by drinking everything with gusto by having a good time for the first time in your natural life,3
so you want to make a strike breaker out of me i am surprised at you comrade is it too much for the workers of the world to ask you to walk around the corner for lunch all i can say to you is take your hammer and sickle and get out of that royal suite,3
send me a plate of raw carrots and beets beets predominating on a ratio of sixtyforty what there is a strike in the kitchen good will you assure the strikers of my hearty sympathy in their cause i hope they will not weaken in their demands and tell them to put no dressing whatsoever on my vegetables what you wont serve me either now look here comrade i think it is a fine idea to let the capitalists go without luncheon but when you keep food away from me youre weakening the people,3
room service speaking,3
i kissed the polish lancer too before he died,3
but ninotchka i held you in my arms you kissed me,3
ninotchka you cant walk out like this im crazy about you and i thought id made an impression on you you liked the white of my eye,3
then do it through my lawyer,3
you know i want to,3
it is out of the question if you wish to approach me,3
tonight lets not represent anybody but ourselves,3
as a representative of moscow,3
all right fight me fight me as much as you want but fight me tomorrow morning theres nothing sweeter than sharing a secret with a bitter enemy,3
i was sent here by my country to fight you,3
i have a better suggestion lets forget that the telephone ever rang i never heard that you are yakushova you are ninotchka my ninotchka,3
lets forget that we ever met,3
ninotchka or shall i say special envoy yakushova,3
i must go,3
but one of your friends may be in need of you you must answer,3
oh let it ring,3
the telephone is ringing,3
glorious analytical,3
oh my barbaric ninotchka my impossible unromantic statistical,3
thank you,3
no that was restful again,3
was that talkative,3
you analyze everything out of existence you analyze me out of existence i wont let you love is not so simple ninotchka ninotchka why do doves bill and coo why do snails coldest of all creatures circle interminably around each other why do moths fly hundreds of miles to find their mates why do flowers open their petals oh ninotchka ninotchka surely you feel some slight symptom of the divine passion a general warmth in the palms of your hands a strange heaviness in your limbs a burning of the lips that is not thirst but a thousand times more tantalizing more exalting than thirst,3
its false sentimentality,3
i cant possibly think of a better reason,3
thats the way a clock works theres nothing wonderful about it you merely feel you must put yourself in a romantic mood to add to your exhilaration,3
its midnight one half of paris is making love to the other half look at the clock one hand has met the other hand they kiss isnt that wonderful,3
its twelve oclock,3
do you hear that,3
youre the most adorable cog i ever saw in my life ninotchka cogitska let me confess something never did i dream i could feel like this toward a sergeant,3
just what you see a tiny cog in the great wheel of evolution,3
what kind of a girl are you anyway,3
dont pity me pity the polish lancer after all im alive,3
poor ninotchka poor poor ninotchka,3
a polish lancer i was sixteen,3
id love to tsk tsk tsk,3
i was a sergeant in the third cavalry brigade would you like to see my wound,3
wounded how,3
i was wounded before warsaw,3
the bayonet did you really,3
its never too late to change i used to belong to the petty bourgeoisie myself my father and mother wanted me to stay and work on the farm but i preferred the bayonet,3
im at a loss ninotchka you must forgive me if i appear a little old fashioned after all im just a poor bourgeois,3
dont do it please,3
id like to say it a thousand times,3
you repeat yourself,3
youre the most improbable creature ive ever met in my life ninotchka ninotchka,3
you dont have to do a thing chemically we are already quite sympathetic,3
what can i possibly do to encourage such an impulse in you,3
i acknowledge the existence of a natural impulse common to all,3
oh i see what do you use instead,3
you are bringing in wrong values love is a romantic designation for a most ordinary biological or shall we say chemical process a lot of nonsense is talked and written about it,3
your cornea is terrific tell me youre so expert on things can it be that im falling in love with you,3
look at me the whites of your eyes are clear your cornea is excellent,3
thank you,3
your general appearance is not distasteful,3
ninotchka do you like me just a little bit,3
that is correct,3
ninotchka,3
you pronounce it incorrectly ni notchka,3
i begin to believe in it myself since ive met you i still dont know what to make of it it confuses me it frightens me a little but it fascinates me ninotchka,3
that is why i believe in the future of my country,3
thank you thank you,3
you are something we do not have in russia,3
for mankind not a thing for womankind the record is not quite so bleak,3
and what do you do for mankind,3
keeping my body fit keeping my mind alert keeping my landlord appeased thats a fulltime job,3
and what is your profession,3
thats great im thirtyfive years old just over six feet tall i weigh a hundred and eightytwo pounds stripped,3
i will start with you,3
not too big and not too small what id call the typical room of an average man or shall we say a little above average now if there are any special aspects you wish to study i have nothing to conceal just look around thats my desk those are my books and here am i where shall we begin,3
i should say this room is eighteen by twentyfive,3
it helps it has ever since king david wooed bathsheba with the harp as i am not so fortunate as to have my harp at hand i shall turn on the radio,3
is that customary,3
we take off our hat and coat we sit down we make ourselves comfortable we adjust ourselves to the prospect of a most enjoyable evening we look at each other we smile well we dont smile how about some music,3
what do we do now,3
thank you ive had all the calories necessary for today,3
well may i offer you a drink or how about something to eat,3
the day will come when you will be free go to bed little father we want to be alone,3
no though the mere thought makes my mouth water,3
he looks sad do you whip him,3
he takes good care of that,3
good evening comrade this man is horribly old you should not make him work,3
yes,3
is this what you call the butler,3
i will do my best,3
then why dont we go you might be an interesting subject of study,3
now i didnt say that either naturally nothing would please me more,3
then you dont want me to go there,3
please dont misunderstand me,3
does that mean that you want me to go there,3
well lets say i live in it such a pleasant place all kinds of comfort easy to reach close to street car bus and subway,3
so that is your house,3
its not the structure but the spirit which dwells within there are three rooms and a kitchenette dedicated to hospitality,3
i see a house that looks like any other house whats remarkable about it,3
what a city there are the grands boulevards blasted out of the heart of the old streets the arc de triomphe made to greet napoleons army the opera and montmartre montparnasse la boh???me and now ill show you the greatest attraction it will cost me a franc but it is worth it the most wonderful spot in all paris unique here look what do you see,3
i do not deny its beauty but it is a waste of electricity,3
you must admit that this doomed old civilization sparkles it glitters,3
do not misunderstand me i do not hold your frivolity against you as basic material you might not be bad but you are the unfortunate product of a doomed culture i feel sorry for you,3
im glad i saw it before becoming extinct,3
yes it is,3
and thank you for getting me up here ive never seen this before beautiful isnt it,3
you gave me some very valuable information thank you,3
yes very strange,3
thats a strange angle,3
four massive piers of masonry are sunk to a depth of fortysix feet on the side of the seine and twenty nine and onehalf feet on the other side the girders of interlaced iron work which stay the structure have an inclination of fiftyfour degrees,3
go ahead,3
the foundation is one hundred and fortyone yards square i hope youll forgive me but i thought youd,3
your type will soon be extinct,3
a russian i love russians comrade i have been fascinated by your five year plan for the past fifteen years,3
i have heard of the arrogant male in capitalistic society it is having a superior earning power that makes you like that,3
nothing has occurred recently to shake my confidence,3
you are very sure of yourself arent you,3
madame it is that kind of approach which has made paris what it is,3
for my own information would you call your approach toward me typical of the local morale,3
ill try,3
suppress it,3
i dont have to but i find it natural,3
i am interested only in the shortest distance between these two points must you flirt,3
here here we are here you are and here i am feel it,3
and where are we,3
bad manners to point with your own here the eiffel tower,3
why do you need my finger,3
now isnt that too bad the last time i jumped i forgot to clock it let me see eiffel tower your finger please,3
how long does it take a man to land,3
technical i couldnt help you from that angle you see a real parisian only goes to the top of the tower in moments of despair to jump off,3
i am interested in the eiffel tower from a technical standpoint,3
is that thing lost again listen if you are interested in a view,3
no i am looking for the eiffel tower,3
facing north id hate to commit myself without my compass pardon me are you an explorer,3
correct me if i am wrong we are facing north arent we,3
love to,3
you might hold this for me,3
can i help you,3
youre welcome,3
thank you,3
no,3
in other words you dont know,3
have i do you know when i come to think about it its staggering if i add it all up i must have spent years waiting for signals imagine an important part of my life wasted between whistles,3
have you never been caught in a similar situation,3
thats funny its interesting i never gave it a thought before,3
how many minutes between the first and second whistle,3
what,3
at what intervals does he whistle,3
well until the policeman whistles again,3
how long do we have to wait here,3
gladly,3
yes could you give me some information,3
me,3
you please,3
thank you swana you are very gracious,3
just in case they dont give you your visa to russia i want you to know that i have signed a contract for my memoirs and rented a lovely little ch???teau in the touraine and if you feel the need of a change,3
that does it swana now you mustnt miss your appointment with your hairdresser,3
count dalgout was for several years my personal representative and if it is necessary to sign any affidavit for him ill be delighted,3
now please swana,3
after our talk last night i took it for granted that you would drop in here this morning knowing how difficult it is to get into soviet russia i thought i might be of some assistance to you may i introduce myself i am the duchess swana of russia another russia,3
hello,3
hello leon darling,3
do you expect me to believe that,3
shes gone leon,3
has done what,3
knowing the efficiency of the french air service i think i can guarantee that madame yakushova has already taken off for moscow,3
what is this swana,3
the same old trouble leon youre always late whether youre taking me to the opera or calling for me at a beauty shop youre never on time and now when its a question of your reform late again by about five minutes,3
im afraid thats what it is,3
leon this has the ugly sound of regeneration,3
i have to be simple again swana and you may find it shockingly banal ive thought it over and im willing to take all the consequences even if it means a complete readjustment of my way of living,3
say it over and over again leon words are a wonderful safety valve and thats what you need because you know its impossible dont you,3
it must be serious swana not long ago id have considered such a statement rather juvenile and rather middle class now i can say it without stammering without a blush im in love swana,3
and i thought it was something serious how could you frighten me so,3
there are a hundred ways to approach it but i feel it can best be said in one simple phrase im in love swana,3
brutal frankness if you insist,3
i know you hate the obvious but do you mind if at this moment im not in the least subtle,3
all right ill listen,3
this time swana just this once i must ask you to listen,3
oh no my little volga boatman have you forgotten our first commandment never complain never explain it has worked so often and so perfectly dont lets break the rule and please dont look so guilty otherwise ill,3
yes,3
is this by any chance going to be a confession,3
im the one who should apologize i should have talked to you before,3
did i act stupidly last night should i apologize,3
no thanks swana,3
leon darling how nice have you ordered tea or a cocktail,3
a very wise suggestion leon im afraid madame and i will never agree the only thing we have in common is our lawsuit and that will be decided next week i understand everything will be over by thursday am i right,3
will you do me a favor stop talking about the good old days,3
im going leon but before i leave i must compliment you on your gown madame yakushova is that what theyre wearing in moscow this year,3
theres a charming crowd here tonight isnt there,3
poor madame yakushova here we are talking in mysteries im sure you wonder what its all about,3
months swana,3
he won another blue ribbon and bit the judge ha ha ha i bought him the cutest sweater as a reward you should see him strut down the street in it he looks like a little boulevardier you see count dalgout gave me punchy for my birthday you must have searched weeks before you found anything as divine as punchy didnt you leon,3
no please,3
ive some wonderful news for you leon its about punchy do you mind if i sit down,3
how do you do,3
not at all your highness may i present madame yakushova,3

yes swana,3
its a dream of beauty he never takes my word for anything but i was right wasnt i,3
yes swana you did,3
didnt i tell you benson and benson were the tailors for you,3
yes swana,3
is this your new dress suit,3
thank you,3
now darling soak in your beautiful pine bath and let gaston shave you,3
darling if were going to get anywhere someone has to keep his eyes open,3
you saw all that in one glimpse,3
timeless when she comes into a room youd think that the bolsheviks had taken over paris she wears her cheap miserable blouse as though it were the latest model by schiaparelli what a woman what a woman there is a russian snowstorm in each of her eyes,3
that bad old or young,3
you cant imagine,3
imagine the carpets of a self respecting parisian hotel dirtied by the boots of a muzhik what does she look like,3
well er i caught a glimpse of her when she walked through the lobby,3
you just told me you hadnt seen her,3
that wouldnt have done any good not with her shes the most incredible creature ive ever seen,3
that proletarian in the old days wed have had her flogged,3
no and believe me ive tried everything i must have telephoned her a hundred times ive sent her telegrams ive sent her flowers i asked her to dinner i offered her seats for the opera,3
you havent seen her yet,3
oh please swana i dont know whether im standing on my head or my heels here you are blaming me for neglecting you when im trying to concentrate on another woman and cant get near her,3
now here we have two very handsome softboiled eggs do you suppose hens mind what happens to their eggs probably not they have such unfeeling eyes well put in a great nugget of butter plenty of pepper and salt darling i havent seen you for three livelong days seventytwo hours,3
not in your condition make it tepid gaston tepid and tender and lay out his gray suit afterwards ill drive you through the bois slowly in waltz time,3
make it ice cold,3
darling youre taking my business affairs far too seriously much as id love to rob the bolsheviks of their filthy money i wont do it at the expense of your health particularly as we know we wont get much you look so pale pale but interesting,3
i just couldnt sleep i got up and went back and then got up again these last few days whew,3
dont tell me the bed has lost its best friend,3
no,3
is anything wrong are you ill,3
huh,3
leon what in heavens name,3
darling calm down why do you need a lawyer havent you your little volga boatman,3
it looks pretty hopeless there may be a chance thats all the french government has recognized soviet russia and he doubts that they will risk a war for my poor sake he might be able to make up some kind of a case but it would cost money money money thats all they are interested in those lawyers,3
what did he say,3
shhh but how can there be a question are you my lawyer or theirs all right ill let you know,3
what does he say,3
this is the duchess swana i want to speak to monsieur cornillon its very important please get him right away hello monsieur cornillon the most incredible thing has happened my jewels are here in paris three bolshevik swine are trying to sell them yes yes we must act immediately call the police have them arrested well then get an injunction but do something monsieur cornillon but they are my jewels there must be some way of getting them back,3
rakonin bless him has given me the most amazing news,3
did i hear something about jewels,3
tell him i wont be able to see him for a half an hour,3
oh yes,3
hes a waiter at the clarence poor devil you know him,3
too bad brings our price down ten thousand francs,3
was i no not by a bolshevik,3
darling this would be wonderful just once werent you attacked by a bolshevik,3
a couple of bloodhounds and we have uncle toms cabin,3
ive got one chapter guizot thinks is terrific caviar and blood swana escapes over the ice,3
well two million readers i know exactly what they want chapter one a childhood behind golden bars lovely little princess plays with rasputins beard,3
yes im your little volga boatman,3
first tell me are you my little volga boatman,3
now swana,3
my little volga boatman stop threatening i dont deserve this are you my little volga boatman,3
imagine two million clerks and shop girls peeking into my life for a sou think of my lovely life being wrapped around cheese and blood sausages i can see a big grease spot in the midst of my most intimate moments,3
i understand how you feel but there is a limit to everything particularly pride and dignity they are willing to pay any price they have a circulation of two million,3
was it for this that i refused to endorse dr bertrands mouthwash i could have made a little fortune by saying that the vincent vacuum cleaner was the only vacuum cleaner ever used by the romanoffs and now you want them to smear my lifes secrets over the front page of a tabloid,3
sweetheart we wont have to bother about our future if you are willing to raffle off your past,3
oh leon,3
now listen swana i sold monsieur guizot the idea of publishing your memoirs in the gazette parisienne the life and loves of the grand duchess swana of russia,3
what a gruesome proof of the power of the press,3
youd be surprised how many nice people dine with the guizots,3
those newspaper people,3
we can be rich if you say the word i had dinner with the guizots last night,3
oh leon you are so good to me,3
we can forget horse racing roulette the stock market our worries are over you remember that platinum watch with the diamond numbers you will be in a position to give it to me,3
did you win,3
darling i was busy looking out for your interests,3
dont you find that restful why didnt you come last night,3
your conversation has one marvelous advantage swana however many questions you ask you never expect an answer,3
its really a wretched morning wretched i cant get myself right i wanted to look mellow and i look brittle my face doesnt compose well all highlights how can i dim myself down leon suggest something i am so bored with this face i wish i had someone elses face whose face would you have if you had your choice oh well i guess one gets the face one deserves,3
good morning swana,3
hello leon,3
i think i know leon quite as well as you possibly a little better leave that worry to me fiveforty leaves you time enough to close the deal with monsieur mercier but naturally youll be too busy for any farewells ill see to it that everything is done in the most expeditious manner and i will also see you to the airport thats my proposition comrade yakushova,3
thats not the way to win him back not leon,3
i am willing to hand over the jewels and sign the necessary papers if you take that fiveforty plane to moscow,3
go on,3
no i just wanted to be absolutely impartial both of us are faced with two rather uncomfortable years we can condense these two years to two minutes if you want to accept my proposition ninotchka now realizes what she is after,3
i see you have calculated in terms of hunger,3
i may run out of money but you have already run out of bread two years is a long time for your comrades to wait,3
wont those two years in court be expensive for you i know that money was no object as long as you could squeeze it from the pockets of the people but now,3
my lawyer agrees with you he says france will uphold it in every court but i will drag you through every court dont forget that and when i say it will take two years i am as always conservative,3
under soviet law the jewels belong to the state france is going to uphold that ownership,3
unfortunately,3
in other words moral ideas have no weight with you all right then lets deal with legal facts you know that france has recognized the soviet,3
now lets free ourselves from emotionalism and try to solve the problem in a practical way our situation has changed considerably before i had only a claim to the jewels now i have the jewels,3
i told you we had plenty to talk about shall we sit down,3
they always belonged to the russian people they were paid for with their sweat their blood their lives and you will give them back,3
thats very simple to answer they were given to me by my mother they were given to her by her mother in fact theyre mine you cannot steal what belongs to you,3
i will have to face the consequences but so will you dont forget they will ask how you got them,3
wont it be rather embarrassing for a soviet envoy to disclose the circumstances under which she lost them,3
you leave me no choice,3
dont worry fortunately last night a very trustworthy friend kept his eyes open perhaps he overstepped his function as a waiter but he fulfilled his duty as a russian i just put this on for sentiment the rest are absolutely safe i assure you but if you feel like notifying the police,3
where are they,3
you were very careless with our precious jewels my dear theyre too expensive a toy for two children to play with,3
where are they,3
believe me leon cant help you he doesnt know anything about the jewels i give you my word i swear it,3
i told you to go madame,3
i wouldnt waken leon after last night i would say not before three oclock at the earliest,3
in that case i can only say goodby,3
not before you agree to use those reservations to moscow,3
i must insist that you leave,3
you cant deny we gave the people their moneys worth almost eight tumbling romanoffs eight,3
my dear you dont know how impressive i could be did you ever see me in my regalia with my diadem and all my jewels,3
it is not enough to be witty madame people grow tired of being entertained you made that mistake before problems were never solved by bowing from a balcony,3
very interesting my dear but couldnt you write all that from moscow a dissertation on love on soviet stationery would be an amusing paradox,3
people cannot be taken away madame neither a hundred and sixty million nor one not if you have their love you hadnt thats why youre not in russia any longer and thats why you came here this morning,3
my palace in petrograd yes you took that away from me you took away my czar my country my people everything i had but nothing more i warn you,3
if this is meant to be a joke it is not funny or do you still think youre issuing orders from your palace in petrograd,3
dont worry i have already made reservations its perfect flying weather they assure me theres a fine tail wind which will sweep you back to moscow in no time,3
madame if you,3
leave thats exactly what i came here to ask you to do leave i dont mean this hotel and i dont mean paris i mean france theres a plane for moscow at fiveforty,3
i must ask you to leave,3
thats all right i grow on people,3
madame what is it you people always say regardless of what you mean i am delighted to have you here i have not reached that stage of civilization,3
now there you are completely wrong if we sit down for a little chat im sure we wont run out of conversation and whats more it wont be dull,3
we have nothing to discuss,3
i just dropped in to have a little hearttoheart talk with you,3
please come to the point what is it you want,3
dont worry you were quite rude enough do you mind if i let in a little fresh air and sunshine im sure it will make you feel better and i want you to be at your very best in full possession of your faculties at least,3
if you were encouraged to come here by our meeting last night i am afraid you misunderstood my attitude,3
how stale last nights gaiety looks it has the taste of a dead cigarette,3
of course not my dear i didnt come here with any such suspicion how ridiculous nor did i come here to pick up his hat,3
i think we can cut your visit short leon is not here,3
it is tomorrow morning tomorrow noon to be exact i hope you will forgive me i know its extremely cruel to waken anyone at such an hour dont you recognize me i am the duchess swana,3
what,3
good morning,3
it is unfortunate that you have so few more days in paris be sure and redouble your efforts so that madame can take some pleasant memories when she returns to moscow good night good night leon,3
youre right madame it will all be over by thursday,3
youre absolutely right about the cossacks we made an unpardonable mistake when we let them use their knouts they had such reliable guns,3
exactly you see it would have been embarrassing for people of my sort to wear lowcut gowns in the old russia the lashes of the cossacks across our backs were not very becoming and you know how vain women are,3
isnt it amazing one gets a wrong impression of the new russia it must be charming im glad conditions are so improved i assume this is what the factory workers wear at their dances,3
dear me i must be losing my finesse if im not careful ill be understood by everybody,3
not at all i understand perfectly count dalgout gave you a dog you made it very clear madame,3
that depends on the tip,3
thats no business thats a social injustice,3
well thats my business madame,3
why,3
may i have your bags madame,3
what do you want,3
here please,3
i will do my best,3
please dont waste my time comrade do your duty goodby,3
how can i make myself clear it is difficult to express but id rather not go to foreign countries any more please comrade let me stay here let me finish my work i am in the rhythm of it now i dont want to go away i dont want to be sent into that foreign atmosphere again it throws one out of gear let me finish my work i have concentrated everything in it please dont make me go,3
i dont understand,3
i am sorry i dont want to overstep my position but please dont send me,3
that is for me to decide comrade yakushova,3
i appreciate the confidence you show in me but i must ask you to entrust someone else with this mission i should hate to interrupt my present work i am positive that my survey is more important than finding out whether three of our comrades have been drinking some extra glasses of champagne,3
yes leaving immediately,3
you want me to go to constantinople,3
it gives details which couldnt be invented naturally i want to verify it and thats why i need you,3
oh they shouldnt do such things are you sure this report is correct,3
as soon as our representatives go to a foreign country they seem to lose all sense of balance if i told you whats going on in constantinople right now you wouldnt believe it those three have been sitting there for six weeks and havent sold a piece of fur this anonymous report was sent me they are dragging the good name of our country through every caf??? and night club here how can the bolshevik cause gain respect among the moslems if your three representatives buljanoff iranoff and kopalski get so drunk that they throw a carpet out of their hotel window and complain to the management that it didnt fly,3
may i ask what has happened,3
i havent either but ive heard about them you must realize it was only on the strength of your paris report that i sent them to constantinople without that i never would have trusted them on a mission as important as the fur deal,3
no,3
well comrade have you heard from your friends kopalski buljanoff and iranoff,3

this morning three soviet agents arrived i overheard a telephone conversation with mercier the jeweler your highness they are going to sell them,3
alexis do you know what you are saying,3
they are here your jewels here in paris,3
why do you bring this up after so many years,3
i remember one birthday of his majesty our beloved czar i had the honor of being on guard at the summer palace i still see you bending before his majesty you wore your diadem and a necklace your face seemed to be lighted by the jewels,3
my jewels,3
no madame something of the utmost importance it concerns your jewels,3
what is it rakonin did you lose your job,3
your highness forgive this intrusion but,3
how do you do my friend,3
your highness,3
but sir well have to start over from the beginning we dont have the staff to,3
for christs sake it soils my mothers memory do you think i want the whole goddamn world to see my mother like this raising a dirty mouth,3
you dont need to check the tape i know what i said,3
we could check the tape again sir,3
never i never said that about jews,3
you did say it sir,3
youre lawyers how can you let this shit go by look this nixon cant say this,3
then tell richardson to fire him,3
sir if i may echo my concern,3
they cant impeach me for bombing cambodia the president can bomb anybody he wants,3
sir the charges are serious first abuse of power second obstruction of justice third failure to cooperate with congress and last bombing cambodia,3
yeah well i own the fucking casino,3
thats helms hes sang froid a worldclass poker player,3
well he certainly isnt acting like it,3
hes nervous sir hes heard youre looking for a new director,3
well see about that,3
frankly sir it stinks i have no access im lucky helms lets me have a staff,3
hows the job coming bob,3
then his office will be fine,3
no his office i want a very private conversation i dont want to be bugged,3
he told me to take you to his conference room,3
so lets go,3
uh hes rushing back from his tennis game sir,3
where the hell is he,3
mr president i dont know what to say as soon as we learned from the secret service you were en route the director was notified he should be here any minute,3
good you know how i feel about loyalty im not going to let any of my people go to jail that i promise you the important thing is to keep this away from haldeman and ehrlichman im trusting you to do that john i have complete confidence in you,3
i understand that sir,3
john you dont want to start down that road i remember what whittaker chambers told me back in 48 and he was a man who suffered greatly he said on the road of the informer its always night this is beyond you or even me its the country john its the presidency,3
im not going to be the scapegoat for this haldeman and ehrlichman are in just as deep as me,3
nobody knows more about this thing than you do john,3
you want me to put it all in writing over my signature,3
we have nothing to hide but the only flaw in the plan is that theyre not going to believe the truth that is the incredible thing,3
no we have nothing to hide,3
hes right maybe its time to go to the hangout route john a full and thorough investigation weve cooperated with the fbi well cooperate with the senate what do we have to hide,3
i mean who the hell cares about this pennyante shit goldwater put it right he said well for christs sake everybody bugs everybody else we know that its the coverup not the deed thats really bad here if only mitchell could step up and take the brunt of it give them the hors doeuvre and maybe they wont come back for the main course thats the tragedy of all this mitchells going to get it in the neck anyway its time he assumed some responsibility,3
i agree its ridiculous but,3
jesus everything is a crisis among the upper intellectual types the softheads the average people dont think its much of a crisis for christs sake its not vietnam no ones dying here isnt it ridiculous,3
sir i still dont think uh we can contain it anymore theres a cancer on the presidency and its growing with every day that,3
you say john cut our losses and all the rest but suppose the thing blows and they indict bob and the others jesus youd never recover from that john its better to fight it out instead and not let people testify,3
im still not confident we can ride through this some people are going to have to go to jail hunts not the only problem haldeman let me use the 350000 cash fund in his safe to make the payments ehrlichman had a role a big role in the ellsberg breakin and im uh i think its time we begin to think in terms of cutting our losses,3
we could get a million dollars we could get it in cash i know where it could be gotten,3
uh huh,3
we could get that,3
uh i would say these people are going to cost a million dollars over the next two years,3
how much do you need,3
either it goes to mitchell or it comes here,3
mitchell mitchells family,3
i like that thats a solution,3
hunt has nothing to lose now pardon all of them nobodys going to investigate a crime for which the criminals have already been pardoned,3
what,3
executive clemency,3
pay him pay him what he wants,3
he says if he doesnt get it right away hes going to blow us out of the water and he means it ever since his wife died in the plane crash hes been over the edge,3
son of a bitch,3
mr president hunt wants more money another hundredandthirty thousand,3
then what about this washington post crap woodwind and fernstein,3
siricas just trying to force one of them to testify but theyre solid,3
so what about those watergate clowns john this fuck siricas crazy thirtyfiveyear sentences there were no weapons right no injuries there was no success its just ridiculous,3
excia theres no such thing as excia john theyre all ivy league establishment is he one of these guys with a beef against us,3
the bigger problem i see is this guy who was arrested mccord james mccord he headed up security for the committee to reelect he turns out to be excia,3
john sooner or later sooner i think you are going to learn the lesson that has been learned by everyone who has ever gotten close to richard nixon that hes the darkness reaching out for the darkness and eventually its either you or him look at the landscape of his life and youll see a boneyard,3
howard youll serve no more than two years then hell pardon you,3
im one of his people the cubans are his people and were going to jail for him,3
to protect his people,3
thats not the question john the question is why is he paying,3
how the hell do you have the temerity to blackmail the president of the united states,3
in richard nixons long history of underhanded dealings he has never gotten better value for his money if i were to open my mouth all the dominoes would fall,3
is it,3
ill bet he would,3
the president would like to know if that was the last payment,3
yes i got the money,3
i was sorry to hear about your wife,3
so you tell mitchell,3
dick nixon saying im sorry thatll be the day the whole suit of armord fall off,3
eight words back in 72 i covered up i was wrong im sorry and the american public wouldve forgiven him but we never opened our mouths john we failed him,3
christ we created frankenstein with those fucking cubans,3
they went after castro in some crazy way it got turned on kennedy i dont think the p knows what happened but hes afraid to find out its got him shitting peach pits,3
yeah,3
i think he means the kennedy assassination,3
i figured that out,3
its a code or something,3
you think this is just about politics,3
the old man plays politics harder than anybody else,3
sure they did stuff but nothing like this bob forget watergate the breakins the enemies list you got an attempted firebombing at the brookings institution planting mcgovern stuff on the guy that shot wallace trying to slip lsd to jack anderson,3
how so,3
hes wrong you know about kennedy lbj truman,3
cause he hates you its worse when you get it from someone you trust,3
why me,3
you do it,3
whos gonna tell mitchell,3
yeah i knew it i knew it from 69 on and i said it all along didnt i,3
yeah sullivan thinks henrys leaking hes the one,3
its the fall of the roman empire are you blind and were putting fig leaves on the statues,3
lets not forget theyre just kids they dont vote,3
anyway they had to take her to bellevue maybe shell stay this time,3
it was her wrist and it was through a plateglass door,3
we are covering up for some petty stupid shit there are things i can say when other people say them theyd be lies but when i say them nobody believes me anyway,3
executive privilege will make it look like were covering up,3
no youre not youre going to claim executive privilege and youre going to stonewall it all the way plead the fifth amendment i dont give a shit they cant force the presidents people to testify,3
sir bob and i are gonna have to testify before earvins committee,3
i dont know i dont know i just know weve made too many enemies,3
and what am i supposed to do just sit here and watch them coming closer eating their way to the center lyndon bugged so did kennedy fdr cut a deal with lucky luciano christ even ike had a mistress whats so special about me what about lyndon he could make a couple of calls to the hill and shut this whole thing down did anyone talk to him,3
itll never wash pardoning them means were guilty the people the press will go nuts,3
forget it ehrenbergs paid three times that much,3
what about england,3
my point exactly somebody had to die before his shit got in the paper fucking kennedys get away with everything do you see me screwing everything that moves for christs sake i did what the new york times editorial page said we should do i ended the war i got salt i with the russians i opened china so why are these cocksuckers turning on me because they dont like the way i look where i went to school,3
he got pretty burned at chappaquiddick,3
i end the longest war in american history and they keep harping on this chickenshit you know whos behind this dont you its teddy kennedy he drowns a broad in his car and he cant run for president,3
no no hes our only star right now hed go crying straight to the press hed crucify us the sonofabitch get someone from our staff on his ass tap his phones i want to know everyone he talks to,3
i would personally enjoy doing that sir,3
looks like he talked to joe kraft and to the times told them he was dead set against the bombing that you were unstable claims he has to handle you with kid gloves,3
no you didnt bob,3
the hardcore four million nixon nuts arent gonna go for it theyll say i sold out to the communists,3
the countrys loving it,3
well no place where they speak english that way he can always say he was misquoted,3
hes begging for a meeting chief he wants to go overseas for awhile,3
yeah good old spiro well better him than me what the hell is he but an insurance policy,3
hes in the dumps sir agnew every time you have him attack the press they give it back to him in spades hes become the most hated man in america,3
sir theres dead american kids here lets say we dont apologize for kent state but maybe we could have a national prayer day,3
the soldiers were provoked the students started it for christs sake,3
as long as hes got secret files on everybody i dont want em used against us what about the cia helmss done nothing for us i want to see him,3
i thought the gloves were off,3
we cant touch hoover,3
no i can do this because ive spent my whole career building anti communist credentials,3
excuse me are you talking about recognizing china mr president that would cost us our strongest support,3
i will not go down as the first american president to lose a war going into cambodia bombing hanoi bombing laos it buys us time so we can get out and give the south vietnamese a fighting chance,3
is the war worth it is it worth a oneterm presidency because i think right now thats what were looking at,3
why not,3
i dont know if id go that far sir,3
oh i suppose you wouldve just let them take over these arent fraternity pranks john its anarchy a revolution,3
we should set up a cuban defense fund on this take care of all of them,3
no sir,3
this is not a joke john,3
uh weve never done this before sir how do we pay in hundreds do you fill a black bag full of unmarked bills,3
its more than that it could be more than that i want hunt paid,3
what the hell are you doing ehrlichman screwing with the cia i dont care how much he wants pay him,3
pay him i told him to get out of the country its crazy to start,3
pay him,3
he wants money,3
and,3
in hiding he sent liddy to talk to me,3
wheres hunt now,3
sure lyndon jfk fdr i mean truman cut the shit out of my investigation of hiss back in 48,3
is it legal i mean has anyone ever done it before,3
i like it i like the idea,3
well hes photogenic lets try dog bones,3
goddamn how long have we had this fucking dog two years he still doesnt come we need a dog that looks happy when the press is around,3
he left his white house phone number in his hotel room,3
hunt howard hunt,3
who not another goddamn cuban,3
well sir it turns out one of the people implicated is still you see on our white house payroll,3
i dont have time for all this shit just handle it bob keep it out of the white house what else kissingers waiting hes gonna throw a tantrum again if i dont see him threatening to quit again,3
find out what the hell he was doing at creep this could be trouble these cia guys dont miss a trick this could be a setup,3
mccord,3
no magruder that sonofabitch tests my quaker patience to the breaking point,3
mitchell,3
marthas an idiot shell do anything to get johns attention if mitchelld been minding the store instead of that nut martha we wouldnt have that kid magruder runnin some thirdrate burglary was he smoking pot,3
jesus through a window,3
mitchells out of his mind now martha just put her head through a plateglass window,3
jesus did mitchell know,3
colson doesnt know about it hes pure as a virgin on this one its just not clear the burglars knew what they were looking for they were heading to mcgoverns office later that night,3
that smell i mean everybody suffered so much their sons killed they need to sacrifice something yknow appease the gods of war mars jupiter i am that blood general i am that sacrifice in the highest place of all all leaders must finally be sacrificed,3
sir,3
it came over from vietnam you know,3
i know it well sir,3
they smelled the blood on me this time al i got soft you know that rusty metallic smell,3
its gone no one will ever find out whats on it,3
you mentioned the bay of pigs several times sooner or later theyre going to want to know what that means theyre going to want to know what was on that gap,3
i dont know anything about that,3
three days before on the june twentieth tape the one with the eighteenminute gap,3
thats right,3
sir you talked about opening up the whole bay of pigs thing again,3
there is nothing in that statement the president cant explain,3
we cant survive this sir they also have you instructing dean to make the payoff to hunt,3
how do you see this,3
that was civil war,3
lincoln used it,3
the army,3
and if i stay,3
if you resign you can keep your tapes as a private citizen you can fight them for years,3
its the supreme court sir you dont get around it,3
can we get around this al,3
sir the deadline is today,3
its totally out of context i was protecting the national security i never intended,3
your lawyers feel its the smoking gun,3
so,3
june twentythird 72 sir the part thats underlined your instructions to haldeman regarding the cia and the fbi,3
im afraid we have another problem mr president,3
victory at sea al henry the pacific theatre christ you can almost feel the waves breaking over the decks,3
i had no knowledge of the coverup until john dean told me about it on march twentyfirst and i did not intend that payment to hunt or anyone else be made,3
hes completely lost touch with reality,3
an action that will at last once and for all show that what i knew and what i did with regard to the watergate breakin and coverup were just as i have described them to you from the very beginning,3
the hell he will fire him too if you have to go all the way down to the janitor at the justice department fire the sonofabitch and,3
richardson wont do that hell resign,3
but he works for the attorney general only richardson can fire him,3
cox fire him,3
who,3
a dozen i got half of em elected i still got the south and goldwater and his boys ill take my chances with the senate,3
about a dozen,3
for what,3
congress is considering four articles of impeachment sir,3
who the fuck does cox think he is i never made a dime from public office im honest my dad died broke you know the sonofabitch went to law school with jack kennedy the last gasp of the establishment they got the hell kicked out of em in the election so now they gotta squeal about watergate cause we were the first real threat to them in years and by god al we would have changed it changed it so they couldnt have changed it back in a hundred years if only,3
can the president afford to ignore a subpoena,3
let em try i appointed three of those bastards im not giving em my tapes,3
this could trigger the impeachment theyll go to the supreme court next,3
its the presidents personal property i will never give up my tapes to a bunch of kennedyloving harvard democrat cocksuckers,3
these state department jerks bill dont understand you got to electrify people with bold moves bold moves make history like teddy roosevelt tr rushing up san juan hill small event but dramatic people took notice,3
thats what theyre doing,3
exactly weve got to take the war to them hit em where it hurts right in the nuts more assassinations more killings right al,3
night al,3
i dont have a pistol,3
you know al men in your profession you give em a pistol and you leave the room,3
youre all set sir just push this button good night mr president,3
damn right and theres still a helluva lotta people out there who wanna believe thats the point isnt it they wanna believe in the president,3
no sir you did not,3
youve never been a greater example to the country than you are now sir but but you need to get out more sir and talk to the people no one i know feels close to you,3
theres no secrets here al,3
may i say something mr president,3
not like the others dean mccord the rest we never got our side of the story out al peopleve forgotten i mean fuck you mr president fuck you tricia fuck you julie and all that shit just words but what violence the tear gassing the riots burning the draft cards black panthers we fixed it al and they hate me for it the double dealing bastards they lionize that traitor ellsberg for stealing secrets but they jump all over me cause its nixon theyve always hated nixon,3
at least mitchell stood up to it,3
i trusted mitchell it was that damn big mouth wife of his,3
mr hoover was a realist,3
yknow al if hoover was alive none of this wouldve happened he wouldve protected the president,3
go on,3
sorry,3
its marked also theres june twenty third and this year march twenty first those are the ones,3
this is june twentieth,3
sir six bodies,3
there can be no whitewash at the white house two wrongs do not make a right i love america god bless america and god bless each and every one of you,3
no,3
more light chief,3
for gods sake when does this end,3
helms wants iran or there might be problems all of his old cia buddies are over there making a fortune off the shah,3
townsend gave us 300 grand belgiums not worth more than 100 150,3
put townsend in belgium its available,3
i promised iran to townsend,3
hell give us the documents but i think he should be offered the ambassadorship to iran then hell go without a whimper,3
what about the documents he promised,3
i was wondering whats such dynamite in this bay of pigs story although it was clearly effective because all of a sudden it was no problem for helms to go to the fbi and try to put a lid on watergate,3
when i met with him he said,3
how,3
we could leverage helms,3
what is this place,3
its a surprise,3
i dont know where are we going,3
what about essential energy the soul does that go into the air too you think theres a good energy and a bab energy,3

and heat and chemical reactions where does it all go when you die,3
yeah i knowsynapses neurong,3

you dont have to you just have to believe in energy,3
like a haunted house right i dont believe in ghosts,3
at first i wasnt sure because you said that you never had anyting like last night happen before but i found out that most people have the potential for tuning in to the other world and neve do it has something to do with the environment like they have to be in a place thats sending signals,3

youre damon bradley,3
larry did you rent a car,3
hes gone he told me what happened he just left for the airport,3
im fine have you seen peter,3
i dont know ive just been thinking maybe this destiny thing is more of a doityourself operation maybe the things that are meant to be are the things we want badly enough to fight for,3
what about larry,3
and larry,3
well i ought to be getting home anyway the kidsll be back from camp soon the house is probably a mess,3
oh,3
actually no theres not going to be a wedding,3
well i realized if youre getting married youre gonna be needing the maid of honor right,3
i didnt expect you back so soon,3
uh huh,3
kate is that you,3
so i guess ive got a wedding to go to,3
so,3
when you couldve found one in america,3
i came all the way to italy in search of a weasel,3
yup,3
i spent my whole life waiting for a creep,3
yes he is,3
hes a jerk,3
or maybe itll turn him back into a toad,3
maybe if i kiss him ill feel it,3
i thought this was supposed to be the one guy in the world you wouldnt need to change,3
maybe i can change him,3
no i think maybe youve been right i think i may have been too critical in the past,3
and he is living proof,3
no ones perfect kate,3
not only is he a mommas boy and a fascist he says nuculear and irregardless,3
uh huh okay well be there how is he anyway,3
kate thank god youre there i need help,3
faith im kidding is this how you plan to get what you want from life when you finally find it you turn and run away from it,3
my god youre right,3
it means youre a completely worthless excuse for a human being and the fates have all conspired to make you miserable,3
what if he doesnt like me,3
whatareyoudoing,3
is damon bradley here,3
joan collins stayed here,3
hes down in someplace called positano peter says we can make it there by morning,3
amazing,3
yes isnt that amazing,3
peter found him,3
ill be back before you leave,3
im sure and kate thank you for coming thank you for being such a good friend,3
you sure youll be okay,3
no no you go ahead,3
im just not ready to go home quite yet thats all,3
what,3
who said i was going,3
the last dead end in a long series of dead ends that i am relieved to finally be leaving behind may as well start packing our cabs gonna be here in an hour,3
peter peter was a mistake an imposter,3
what about peter,3
yeah well obviously it wasnt meant to be ive got fortyeight hours i can still make it home in time to marry dwayne and try to forget any of this ever happened,3
and a fortune teller,3
it was a ouija board remember,3
i know but,3
i thought you were the one who didnt think i shouldve come in the first place,3
so youre just quitting just like that,3
why do they read kids fairy tales in the first place children are very impressionable you know,3
okay a lot of bad luck but that means the odds are probably in your favor now this is no time to give up,3
a little bad luck,3
so youve had a little bad luck,3
because ive been kidding myself because i realized you were right from the beginning this whole thing was just a wild goose chase,3
why,3
packing,3
sightseeing whatre you doing,3
hi whereve you been,3
hiiii,3
men have ways,3
but how could he know he only just met me,3
yeah sociopaths theyre able to figure out what you want them to be and then they act like that,3
dont be silly hows a psychiatrist gonna find him,3
no like a psychiatrist,3
like a detective,3
i think its time we got some professional help,3
i meant about my idea,3
that was really sweet,3
and then we rent a truck or a car either one and we set up a loudspeaker and we drive through the surrounding areas and we page him,3
and then what faith,3
okay heres what i think we find out what all the subway stops for that train are the subway systems really not that big in rome we could narrow it down and,3
well nobody can say we didnt try,3
good luck,3
what,3
faith,3
right okay its meant to be right this is it,3
faith so far youve trailed the man halfway around the globe at this point i dont think another fifteen feet is gonna tip the scales,3
right right okay you dont think hes gonna think im too aggressive,3
nope,3
is he looking at us,3
hes sitting in the fourth booth down on the left hand side with his back to us hes wearing a navy jacket if you turn around you can see part of his right elbow,3
oh my god where,3
hes heeeeeerrre,3
okay okay you join him but first will you ask if hes here,3
not if you dont count the sixth grade,3
sure you did,3
i never even got to be single,3
because im the one whos single,3
well how come were always looking for guys for you,3
i told you if he sees me here with another guy hes gonna think im here with another guy i just dont want to send any confusing signals,3
so whats in a name i wanna join him i dont see why we cant join him,3
youve travelled over six thousand miles and now youre gonna play hard to get,3
i sort of wanted to wait to see if maybe hed notice me first,3
youre right at least that way you could spend the rest of your life blaming your parents instead of yourself smile,3
all of the sudden im feeling kind of nervous god i hate blind dates why couldnt we just have arranged marriages in america,3
whats she saying,3
i dont know i just asked her if she knew him and all of the sudden,3
what did you say to her,3
right my brother,3
her brother,3
anna im faith you dont know how happy i am to meet you you see im trying to find someone and,3
polo,3
larry bought himself cologne,3
he went out and bought himself mens cologne the other day did i tell you that,3
and you know what i thought then kate i thought i hope someday i have somebody who loves me that much i still hope that,3
that was a long time ago,3
you know when larry and i got married i thought we were so lucky we found each other so early people talk about spending their lives together how many of them really get to but maybe i was wrong maybe sooner or later everything wears out,3
course he does,3
you think he misses me at all,3
i dont know kate i just said that im sorry im just on edge im afraid were losing him,3
so what exactly is larrys side of the story anyway,3
sorry,3
well you dont have to get snippy with me,3
you expecting somebody you know,3
nothing,3
whats that supposed to mean,3
you know no offense or anything kate but i think im starting to see larrys side of the story,3
im hungry,3
right so we shouldve been able to cover more of them,3
we wouldve had enough gas to get us there if you hadnt gotten us lost besides a kilometer is less than a mile,3
i told you a liter was less than a gallon,3
the book said they have a lot of rail strikes in italy,3
couldnt we just have taken a train,3
what was i gonna do tell him the truth,3
your brother,3
only its in italian,3
only what,3
a phone message only,3
what is it,3
were saved,3
oh right,3
were not looking to arrest the man faith were trying to locate him,3
maybe theres fingerprints on it,3
a rich possibly fat slob,3
a butterfinger wrapper,3
whatd you find,3
ah ha,3
so maybe his room hasnt been cleaned yet maybe theres something in there that might help us maybe theyll let us go in and take a look around,3
so,3
the guy at the desk said he only left about a half hour ago right,3
i just got a dial tone,3
i dont think he understood what you were saying whats the airport number,3
did i or did i not offer to have it cleaned,3
you cant really blame him for being upset it was an armani suit,3
he fell out,3
what are you doing,3
faith ive seen it already okay if i spot somebody whos got a head thats an eighth of an inch around standing underneath a tuba ill recognize him from the photo otherwise im telling you its not gonna do me any good,3
just once more so youll be sure to know what to look for,3
you and the other 99 of the women in the world,3
ill never meet the man of my dreams,3
we lost him,3
you gave it your best shot you tried,3
i cant believe we came all this way and hes gone,3
well were here and more importantly hes here well cut back on everything else,3
yes cathy lee crosby stayed here,3
are you sure,3
of the rich and famous of which we are neither are you out of your mind we cant afford this,3
what,3
this is a lifestyles hotel,3
i dont know maybe think of it as an adventure,3
gritty is this gonna be one of those youth hostel dives jammed with backpackers who dont believe in deodorant,3
its called the gritty palace,3
the book said they have boats that are like taxis vaporettos whats the name of the place were staying again,3
now what do we do,3
sure im fine i dont know why i never did this before i mean whats the big deal,3
you okay,3
youre coming with me,3
i keep it in the glove compartment in case of emergencies,3
maybe,3
live happily ever after,3
how hard can it be ill land there ill go to his hotel ill introduce myself and,3
a foreign land full of millions of italian men speaking italian with italian accents and those huge brown eyes and that silky olive skin,3
he was on his way to venice right i called the tourist bureau and i mustve called every hotel in the city but i found where hes staying,3
youre just going to fly to italy and start combing the streets,3
thank you so much,3
my god you have,3
no i havent and you forgot about the fortune teller,3
look i know you think this is irresponsible of me but think how much more irresponsible it would be to marry the wrong person,3
i cant believe we did this do i have to remind you that your wedding is in six days,3
of course not i told him i was going to visit a great aunt and dont tell larry either,3
does dwayne know about this,3
would you stop saying that i need you to do me a really big favor,3
because you were afraid to fly,3
thats where youre wrong i got one nine years ago i just never had an opportunity to use it,3
you dont have a passport,3
i have vacation time coming to me,3
what about your job,3
its still the new year,3
but its july,3
it was my new years resolution to overcome it,3
the woman at my dry cleaners believes theres no such thing as coincidence,3
its a coincidence,3
its a miracle,3
after all he is my brother and i know he can be kind of a jerk sometimes but i know him pretty well and i really dont think,3
no i can just tell,3
have you seen him with someone,3
i think hes having an affair,3
is that bad,3
larry brought me flowers last night,3
kate is something the matter,3
i mean just how long are you going to cling to this childish illusion that its all supposed to be perfect well guess what it isnt not for you not for anybody,3
i understand kate what do you think of this garter,3
people have problems insecurities flaws and you have to learn to compromise to overlook to forgive its not settling faith its life real life,3
i know youre right,3
let me tell you something about love there are no prince charmings there are no glass slippers love is hard work,3
yeah i guess youre right i really like the wallpaper we picked out for the den,3
but one day you wake up and realize youve been had of course life isnt like the movies thats why there are movies,3
thats the problem when youre a kid you think life is gonna be like the movies dreams come true the good guys win people live happily ever after all that crap turn,3
oh i dont know i guess its just not quite the way i always thought it was going to be you know like in the movies,3
but what,3
i know it was,3
i think it was sweet of him to pick it out,3
look how big it makes me look i look like an alp,3
come on its not so bad,3
well i wouldntve if i hadnt thought i was in love,3
yes you did,3
he begged me to marry him i didnt even want to marry him,3
if youve never been out with him how do you know you dont want to go out with him,3
why should i ask someone out who i dont want to go out with in the first place,3
why dont you ask him,3
no hes never asked me,3
thrills thats what youre waiting for you know how long that lasts besides how do you know have you ever been out with him,3
hes a podiatrist or something,3
you dont have any idea,3
i dont know kate,3
whats he do,3
so hes not my type let me walk you to the elevator,3
so,3
i dont know i dont think so,3
is he gay,3
no,3
is he married,3
no,3
yeah well larry and his friends are hungry and i did say id try to pick something up,3
i wish you didnt have to go so early,3
no faith they came out of somebodys imagination,3
just that they came out of somebodys experience is all,3
so whats your point,3
but somebody wrote those songs,3
yes you know all the shrinks on donahue say that all those love songs about some enchanted evening are just a cruel hoax that feeds peoples fantasies,3
is everything okay,3
i think if youre honest with yourself youll admit youve had a chance at a number of amana appliances in your lifetime,3
metaphorically i still dont have an amana freezer,3
its a metaphor its women who always think theres some unknown out there thats going to be better than whats in front of them and instead wind up with nothing,3
i dont have an amana freezer,3
dont tell me oprah did a show,3
so you gotta be a little flexible look at your brother and me larrys not perfect neither am i but we work it out were not unrealistic in our expectations and we have each other i think youve got the door number three syndrome,3
oh,3
scientologist,3
how about that guy at the bank,3
just moved in with his girlfriend,3
how about the other one his friend,3
no he smokes,3
what about that guy you work with mike whatshisname,3
youre an accountant for cryin out loud,3
i dont believe in statistics,3
yeah hes around somewhere,3
i dont know i guess i never really thought about it is larry here,3
thats exactly what you are,3
huh,3
giovanni,3
you think im just one of those italian casanovas the guys who try to seduce every woman who comes their way who prey on unhappily married women who lure unsuspecting,3
but i do want to,3
you dont have to go if you dont want to,3
no you dont understand its been wonderful meeting you but i have a husband i have two kids at camp i have a life i have to go back to,3
i thank you,3
giovanni i want to thank you,3
what do the years matter ive known you for centuries,3
how old are you,3
you see in america they care for work they live to work but in italy they care for food for love for pleasure,3
oh,3
its siesta,3
id love to,3
oh hello i just came by to see if you wanted to join me for a drink but,3
giovanni this is faiths friend peter,3
oh,3
a pig a pig shes saying hes a pig,3
a porco,3
shes saying hes a a porco,3
my friend is looking for her brother and she thinks this woman knows where he is can you tell us what shes saying,3
this is your most lucky day my family runs a pension not three blocks from here,3
no well i dont know well maybe later,3
you are looking for a place to stay no kate,3
kate,3
and you are,3
she didnt give me a chance,3
and you didnt tell her,3
she said she knew where to find him and then she grabbed my car keys and,3
she what,3
faith larry has something he wants to tell you about damon bradley,3
yeah,3
he missed me,3
i came after the woman i love,3
i cant tell her shes called off her wedding shell never speak to me again,3
larry youve got to tell her,3
it was a harmless little prank who in the world wouldve thought shed spend her life waiting for this guy,3
i thought shed get a kick out of it,3
went to high school with him but,3
he existed he was some kid i knew from little league he was a real jerk you say hes a friend of dwaynes,3
are you saying you just made the whole thing up the guy never even existed,3
it was just a joke i was pushing the arrow i wanted to get to the next question i wanted to find out who was gonna win the series,3
what you know him,3
damon bradley thats why youre here,3
you said it differently then,3
you used to love it when i called you doll,3
dont call me doll larry i hate it when you call me doll,3
were all desperate for the money doll thats what made this country great back me up on this candy am i right,3
sociologist and because pawn shops are just like prostitutes farm auctions and coal miners theyre all for sale but none of em would be if they werent desperate for the money,3
its not exploitation these people wanna sell and i wanna buy how are golf clubs exploitation she takes one night class and suddenly shes a socialist,3
not only is it tacky its exploitation,3
no,3
and we didnt have to bring another present,3
right,3
this is the last one before the wedding right,3
well theres nothing here to eat,3
no why,3
uh yeah sure honey did you forget the guys are coming over tonight,3
you miss me,3
kate youre still there i thought youd be on your way home by now,3
sorry,3
thanks,3
oh its you its only peter,3
arent you gonna go introduce yourself,3
thats the guy youve been waiting for all these years,3
ten billion to one,3
i mean realistically what are the odds that this is a terrific guy,3
thats really romantic,3
and if thats not destiny i dont know what is,3
whatever and i thought please god give me a sign give me some way to keep this woman from getting into that taxi and disappearing from my life forever and he did she told me the name granted it wasnt my name but it was a start,3
mania,3
and then i saw her and all i know is when i looked in her eyes i saw something light and life and passion and yearning and something else i cant even put my finger on something id never seen before,3
do you know i wasnt even supposed to be in rome my boss was supposed to come to this conference and at the last minute he got the measles the measles who gets the measles at fortythree so they sent me and i wasnt supposed to be in that piazza that night either id gone to the movies only it was sold out so i was wandering around just wandering when i got hit in the head with this shoe,3
good strategy,3
it was an emergency i only lied that night because it was the only way i knew to stop her i knew if i didnt id never see her again,3
no thats not fair thats not it at all look something somewhere got screwed up maybe some metaphysical wires got crossed i may not have the right name but i was there im the guy im skywriting,3
she went out to check into skywriting i cant believe you lied is this a genetic thing men will say anything just to get laid,3
where is she,3
shes not here,3
i have to talk to her,3
you know johnny when he gets mad,3
ill come over when im ready,3
id get over there terry ill take the little lady home,3
im gonna take her home first,3
he just got a call from mr upstairs somethings gone wrong hes plenty hot,3
right now,3
when i was a mere spit of a lad on ferry street in dublin the nuns used to say to me nolan dont be swallowin ye words like fishballs when you got something to say?€? ?€?talk with your mouth wide open so if im loud dont blame me?€? its the fault of the nuns,3
and what in blazes have the nuns got to do with it,3
if i talk too loud its the fault of the nuns,3
if you kept your ears wide open instead of your mouth?€?,3
talk louder i cant hear you,3
and dont be walking off with any of that you know how the boss feels about individual pilferage,3
thats all next witness,3
what do you mean odd we was robbed like i told you,3
doesnt it seem odd to you that five different waterfront locals were broken into last night and the only articles removed were financial records,3
we was robbed last night and we cant find no books,3
well where are they,3
sure we keep records,3
you mean to sit there and tell me that your local takes in sixtyfive thousand five hundred dollars every year and keeps no financial records,3
this is for you to figure out you can have it your way or you can have it his way but you cant have it both ways am i right sonny,3
but my own kid bro?€?,3
then dont,3
johnny i cant do that i cant do that johnny,3
confused kid first he crosses me in public and gets away with it and then the next joker and pretty soon im just another fellow down here,3
gerry g you dont want to do that johnny sure the boys outa line but hes just a confused kid,3
very simple just bring him to that place we been using mac you take care of the details call gerry g in if you think you need him,3
what do you want me to do johnny,3
so do i charley for your sake,3
i wish i knew,3
i aint interested in his mental condition all i want to know is is he d n d or is he a canary,3

you like taking risks,3
it would be worth the risk,3
if i remembered you i came looking for you i wouldve said sure lets do it but for all you knew i could show up with a swat team why would you trust me,3
well id say who i was and do you remember me and ask if youd like to meet for a drink,3
if i had answered what were you gonna say,3
i called your room from downstairs,3
oh god,3
or once,3
it doesnt have to its something that happens its like seeing a person you never saw before you could be passing on the street you look at each other and for a few seconds theres a kind of recognition like you both know something but then the next moment the persons gone and its too late to do anything about it but you remember it because it was right there and you let it go and you think what if i had stopped and said something it might happen only a few times in your life,3
well does it make sense to you,3
its not a game something you play,3
its your game ive never played this before,3
i dont think it works if were somebody else you know what i mean gary and celeste jesus what do they know about anything,3
not yet dont say anything yet okay,3
how far do we go with this,3
no what do you do for a living gary,3
having it cleaned didnt help huh,3
it smelled,3
you did,3
i had one just like it well it was the same idea but i had to get rid of it,3
i like your hair and that suit,3
i dont have a problem with it,3
a girl,3
what as a sales rep,3
is that how you think of yourself,3
im a sales rep i came here to call on a customer and they gave me a hard time because im a girl,3
well we got that out of the way tell me celeste what do you do for a living,3

those guys bother you,3
dont leave me,3
i can go to the bar,3
it takes hours to get a drink around here theres only one waitress,3
i just thought maybe you and me could,3
whatta you mean uwellu make it an island,3
im partial to mountains myself but if you like islands well make it an island,3
one last score that the idea move to some island,3
hes dead he did twentyseven years before he came out and died not too long after in charity hospital i think trying to make up for all the good times hed missed thats not gonna be me,3
unless you wanna tell me,3
why you think he might tell you where i am,3
something ive been wondering what ever happened to your uncle cully,3
i can just picture that a cute girl like you following slipandfall and whiplash cheaters,3
my dads retired he was a private investigator forty years i used to work for him,3
because youre having too much fun,3
why not,3
you wont do that,3
theres a guy here on the task force right now maybe i should put him on the phone let you two work it out,3
sure ill just leave em with the swat guy answers the door,3
lets see you could come on by my dads place drop em off,3
how do we do that,3
think i could have them back,3
and your gun,3
how do you know wait you have my wallet,3
really he has a cops face,3
thats my dad,3
im just worried maybe im not old enough for you,3
none of your business,3
who was it answered the phone,3
howd you get this number,3
yes,3
you know who this is,3
shit,3
get your hands up and turn around unowu,3
uhhuh well but if,3
i mean romantically,3
really,3
i never thought it made sense though the way they got together so quick,3
yeah,3
with robert redford when he was young,3
another one faye dunaway was in i liked ithree days of the condori,3
you have to be kidding,3
im just saying i think if we met under different circumstances,3
youd probably tell me,3
i mean if you didnt know who i was,3
nothing,3
youre sure easy to talk to i wonder say we met under different circumstances and got to talking say you were in a bar and i came up to you i wonder what would happen,3
it wasnt pretty after no but if you were in that car eating a sandwich you wouldnt have known what hit you,3
bleeding on a country road,3
yeah right anyway that scene where warren beatty and faye dunaway get shot i remember thinking at the time it wouldnt be a bad way to go if you have to,3
peter finch,3
and the guy saying he wasnt gonna take any more shit from anybody,3
inetworki yeah she was good,3
yeah i liked her in that movie about tv,3
faye dunaway,3
that part in the movie where they get shot warren beatty and i cant think of her name,3
it was may 1934 near gibsland louisiana,3
youre full of interesting facts arent you,3
they put a hundred and eightyseven bullet holes in clyde bonnie parker and the car they were driving bonnie was eating a sandwich,3
is that right,3
i dont recall his hat but ive seen pictures of him lying dead shot by texas rangers did you know he didnt have his shoes on,3
oh you mean of bonnie and clyde hm you ever see pictures of him the way he wore his hat you could tell he had that dontgiveashit air about him,3
you must see yourself as some kind of clyde barrow,3
yeah well if it turns out i get shot like a dog itll be in the street not off a goddamn fence,3
you know this isnt gonna end well these things never do,3
sure,3
we still talk though,3
uhhuh,3
it was just a year give or take a few days i mean its not like we didnt get along or anything we had fun we just didnt have that that thing you know that spark you know what i mean you gotta have that,3
you were married all those falls im surprised you had time,3
jesus you sound like my exwife,3
what do you want me to do scream i dont think it would help much im just gonna sit back take it easy and wait for you to screw up,3
you dont act like it,3
of course i am,3
you dont seem all that scared,3
i dont have to i dont rob banks,3
basically yeah if i go back now i do a full thirty years no time off can you imagine looking at that,3
i know the difference you were in lompoc usp the federal penitentiary ive delivered people there so basically youve spent half your life in prison,3
i believe you would have another fall i did seven years at lompoc and i dont mean the place next door where some of nixons people went,3
it was me i woulda left ol gus on the floor,3
i thought so too,3
thats funny,3
tell you the truth i dont know i started when i was eighteen driving for my uncle cully and his partner gus they go into a bank this one time in slidell gus jumps the counter to get the tellers and breaks his leg all three of us ended up in angola,3
how many was that,3
time i was convicted in california fbi told me id robbed more banks than anyone in the computer,3
why are you famous,3
jack foley youve probably heard of me,3
so whats uyouru name itll be in the paper tomorrow anyway,3
buddy thats his given name,3
who buddy yeah hes a good guy back when we jailed together hed call his sister every week without fail shes a bornagain christian does bookkeeping for a televangelist buddy calls her up confesses his sins tells her about whatever bank he happened to rob,3
if they get set up in time which i doubt and even if they do theyll be looking for a buncha little latin fellas not a big black guy driving a ford,3
you wouldnt have time anyway we come to a roadblock theyll run the car find out in five seconds who it belongs to,3
guys like me huh well listen even though ive been celibate lately im not gonna force myself on you ive never done that in my life,3
the idea of going after guys like you appealed to me,3
yeah went real nice with that twelve gauge too tell me why in the world would someone like you ever become a federal marshall,3
i believe it youve ruined a nine hundreddollar suit my dad gave me,3
boy it stunk in there,3
in my bag in the car,3
wheres your gun your pistol,3
you devil its mace huh whatve you got here a billy use it on poor unfortunate offenders,3

so whats your point,3

the fish saved my life two years ago i found out i had high blood pressure so my doctor he tells me to go get an aquarium look at the fish every time i felt myself stressing out,3
i cant say that ive paid that much attention to em before,3
yeah fish live in the present they dont dwell on yesterday and they dont worry about tomorrow even when a big fish attacks a little fish theres no neurosis involved no guilt afterward no whining on some fishshrinks couch they just do it they accept,3
the fish,3
no need to decide now be like the fish let whatever happens happen,3

its possible why,3
you gonna go get him,3
none id like to share,3
he doesnt seem to hold a grudge what iii want to know is why they got such a big score up north did foley hang around miami for so long any thoughts on that one,3
so what i want to know is why buddy still calls his sister every week even after she turned him in,3
so,3
buddys sister regina mary bragg got two calls from buddy up in detroit this morning called burdon shes also the one gave burdon buddys address,3
i imagine you wouldve though,3
i didnt have time,3
you wave back,3
i couldnt swear to it but im pretty sure he did,3
he waved to you,3
yeah but you talked all the way from gci to the turnpike it sounds more like a first date than a kidnapping,3
foley ikidinapped me,3
you like the wild ones dont you tillman nicolet and now foley you know ive always said theres a thin line between the cowboy cops and the armed robbers all those guys that love to pack,3
my married boyfriend setting him up with that news story so you could talk about infidelity i couldnt believe it,3
maybe but youre also curious about the man twice last night you asked your married boyfriend nicolet about him you were concerned but you didnt want to show it,3
i want to bust his ass put him in shackles,3
but you know hes dirty and you still wanna see him again,3
not at all,3
he remind you of that guy tillman,3
hes pretty laid back confident,3
remember pay attention to how she talks about foley her tone do it right shell tell you things she wouldnt tell burdon tell her you think hes a nice guy no first tell her about being in the trunk with him in the dark for half an hour and see how she takes it if shes in on it what does she get for all the aggravation cops breathing on her i bet nothing so she still likes him enough to stick her neck out you think thats possible what kind of guy is he,3

the brass is afraid of sabotage this makes em easier to protect and easier to service,3
hey what is this the planes all bunched up like that,3
hang on,3
so beautiful,3
from the air,3
wellsure,3
hey have you seen pearl harbor at night,3
he told me he didnt want to leave me with regret now thats all i have,3
sorry,3
i swore not to talk about him tonight but theres all this stuff i think i ought to tell you that he didnt get a chance to rafe washe was lonely he had such high expectations of himself that he always felt empty the week he met you he told me he felt his heart had always lived in winter and for the first time in his life he has seen the spring,3
i was just thinking that war is a series of goodbyes do you think thats why were meeting to help us say goodbye to rafe,3
that might not have been such a good idea theyre making us fly out of a halfpaved airfield the real punishment is that i wont be back to the barracks till its too late for dinner or coffee so i guess its goodbye for awhile,3
we got some soldiers in traction from a jeep accident but its quiet except for the occasional fighter plane buzzing us,3
hows everything,3
he said that,3
he said youre the only one he ever saw who was better in the air than him,3
i taught him to drink beer he taught me how to fly,3
you were more like brothers,3
rafes folks had a crop dusting business owned their own planes real straight frugal my father was the town drunk went to sleep one night on the railroad tracks and was still there when the dawn express came along rafe and i were the only ones at the funeral he took me back to his house and i never left,3
he told me about you that he had no other friend like you,3
before rafe left he asked me to be the one to tell you if it happened,3
were isnt that what you mean were because hes dead isnt he and thats why youve come,3
lieutenant im danny walker im rafe mccawleys best friend,3
yyes sir,3
no baseball diamonds red,3
colonel to ffight you need strategy to have strategy ya gotta practice and to practice it ya gotta play,3
id like to bomb their emperor too but i think thatd just piss em off the idea here gentlemen is not revenge were here to prove to them that theyre neither invincible nor superior so lets try this again military targets only,3
i ddont think japs oughta be allowed to pplay baseball,3
now we have fifteen requests for the emperors palaceand one for tokyo baseball stadium,3
i have a phrase i want you all to memorize lushu hoo megwa fugi it means i am an american in chinese,3
then whwhere do we land,3
we wont have the fuel to get back to the carriers theyll turn and run back to hawaii the minute were airborne,3
ccolonel we been ppracticing takeoffs but i aint sure we can land on these carriers ddecks,3
the navy will get us to within 400 miles of the japanese coast well launch off the carriers from there,3

i thought id made it clear im not just putting this mission together im leading it myself,3
i want to introduce a couple of people doc white is a flight surgeon he has volunteered for gunnery training so that he can go on the mission because we cant spare the weight of an extra man,3
bombers,3
in flight school you qualified in single and in multiengine planes youll be flying multiengines here,3
top secret means you help me pick the other pilots train and go without knowing where youre going until its too late,3

youre just about the only pilots in the army with actual combat experience so youre volunteering for a mission ive been ordered to put together do you know what top secret is,3
is that the good new sir or,3

we can explain colonel,3
i heard what you did,3
thank you sir,3
good luck over there mccawley i admire your decision,3
thank you sir,3
thats bullshit son but its really good bullshit,3
never sir i just meant its dangerous only for the kind of pilot who wants to show off rather than inspire the other pilots in his unit and all youve done for me sir working out the transfer i did it to say thanks to honor you sir what the french call a homage,3
dont get smart with me son,3
how could it be irresponsible sir if you were the first man in the world to do it,3
there are some people who think the outside loop is reckless and irresponsible,3

maybe not but i need you to know i love you and i will come back ill find a way and then well get a chance to know if what i felt the first moment i saw you and every minute since then is real,3
i dont know if you can choose that rafe,3
evelynyou know the line lets make tonight memorable what i feel about you makes it impossible for me to say something like that if i dont come back i dont want to saddle you with regret and sadness youll carry the rest of your life,3
i had to tell you in person because theres something else i need to say,3
you waited til tonight to tell me,3
colonel doolittle pulled the strings and put me on loan to the raf they need pilots and we need experience i leave tomorrow,3
but youre in the us army how could you,3
im going to the war the real war hitlers taken europe the brits are hanging on by their fingernails and if they lose therell be more people killed than anybody can imagine and not just there but here,3
were all going away,3
theres one thing i have to say im going away,3
it surprises me that im not the only one on this balcony who feels that way,3
the only reason its hard to say is that i keep thinking i dont have the right to say it but ive got to because its true i love you that must surprise you,3
whatever youre trying to tell me isnt good is it or it wouldnt be so hard to say,3
i was hoping to meet him,3
no hegot some news today hell be okay he just didnt feel like coming tonight,3
dannys not coming,3
nice to meet you betty,3
oh this is betty,3
you too lieutenant,3
hello lieutenant good to see you,3
and if we fail and lose our carriers we destroy our ability to fight them at all as soon as the second wave returns we will withdraw,3
if we launch the third wave and annihilate their fuel depots we destroy their ability to operate in the pacific for at least a year,3
the second wave has not returned and we have no idea where their carriers are what is the damage report,3
we have achieved complete surprise the first wave is returning the second is attacking now and we have lost only a few planes we can launch a third wave admiral,3
we must go ahead this is our moment,3
we have a fighter screen up in case we are attacked admiral,3
we have achieved surprise but their carriers are not in port i dont like this,3
a brilliant man would find a way not to fight a war,3
brilliant admiral,3
set up teams of radio operators to send out messages the americans will intercept concerning every potential american target in the pacific include hawaii the clutter will be more confusing that way,3
if we achieve surprise they will offer little resistance,3
everything real except the fact that no one is shooting back at us,3
i have arranged a live fire drill with your permission,3
uncharged torpedoes have different balance,3
god help them,3
the chinese are sending out search parties to try to find the crews before the jap patrols do if any of the planes make it,3
so those brave men are flying blind and running out of fuel,3
thereve been some complications sir the chinese didnt receive our request for homing beacons until is was too late to get them set and the planes had to take off so early they may lack fuel to make the mainland anyway,3
have the planes made it to china,3
we have bombed tokyo mr president radio tokyo interrupted its own broadcast to make the announcement,3
weve done studies were confident we would turn them back eventuallyafter theyd gotten as far as chicago,3
what if the japanese did invade,3
crank her,3
i havena been able ta,3
fook ya dooble,3
learn english then,3
fook ya,3
and if you dont give me a plane that can handle combat you better start learning to speak german,3
if yed wanted a bloody cadillac ya shoulda stayed in the bloody states,3
all of em,3
well which of those three ya want fixed,3
the struts are loose the hydraulics are leaking and the electrical systems shorting out in the cockpit,3
leapin jesus,3
the americans themselves have made it possible we will annihilate them in a single attack at pearl harbor,3
you see us as capable of such a blow,3
the council knows i have opposed fighting the americans no matter how great our resolve they have resources beyond ours if we must go to war there is only one way deal them a blow from which it will take them years to recover in that time we can conquer all of the pacific and they will have no choice but to ask for peace,3
you have something to say yamamoto,3
the time has come to strike or to sit and let the americans cut off our oil and our future i know what you whisper to the others yamamoto that the americans are strong yet look at their leader,3
if knowledge of opponents and careful calculation of danger is taken as weakness then i have misunderstood what it means to be japanese,3
so you join us admiral some of us thought your education at an american university would make you too weak to fight the americans,3
its her 18th birthday i want to show her off,3

thats all i wanted to hear cause im never going to give up on us its easy to fall apart in a crisis its easy to be selfish and say goodbye and good luck but this is more than love this is a mental decision just wait till tomorrow when you see your birthday present then youll understand,3
it means i care about you and what happens to you,3
does this mean you like me again,3
if you took the trouble to write it then sure ill take a look at it but im beginning to think that maybe theres more to life than music i wonder if people would still like me if i stopped being mr excitement,3
just take a look at it,3
fat chance you know lee wilkins came to hear me last night he told me to forget it you told me to forget it my parents tell me to forget it,3

im trying to save you years of frustration waiting for a big break no waiting for that big disappointment so you could blame it all on me,3
what what about the group and my singing career what about me,3
everything i have a good head for business i should be franchising the bakery and i want you to give me your word that whatever happens youll go to college and finish,3
but what has to be different,3

what about everything i said to you this afternoon,3
i just cant trust you anymore,3

i will be happy if i have you i love you,3
charlie ive been trying to postpone this but whats the point its over i dont want to hurt you this is very hard for me im doing this for both of us i really want you to be happy,3
look ive got the hair got the eyes got the teeth i got the car im the lead singer im the man,3
and why do you always refer to yourself in the third person like napoleon how come it always turns into an argument with you,3
youre going to blow it peggy sue nobody treats charlie bodell like this,3
you know i never could stand your sarcasm,3
then its true dammit i had a miserable time tonight cause of you when the monotones did book of love ?€??€? chapter four you break up wont you give it just one more chance im thinking did we break up cause if we did i dont even know about it i thought we cleared all that up yesterday did that maynard g beatnik give you what you wanted,3

because nothing else matters thats the great thing about love every time we argue every time something goes wrong and i know that im not perfect either things just work out better in the end cause youre my baby and i love you,3

yeah i know girls mature faster than guys but last night i was the one who put on the brakes and you know why,3
but im not im a grown woman with a lifetime of emotional experiences you couldnt possibly understand,3

cool it kids hes free to see other girls if he wants,3

so you think time travel is possible for people,3
you can till it with whatever you want from illusions to memory from experience to innocence from happiness to the entire universes,3
whats inside,3
well i think time is like a burrito sometimes it just folds over on itself and one part touches the other,3
i	know what a burrito is,3
thats my own theory based on a mexican food called the burrito i had it once when my parents took me to disneyland,3
whats that,3
and then theres richards burrito,3
well in a newtonian framework the possibilities were limited but with the advent of relativity theory the idea of absolute time can no longer be reasonably affirmed,3
sort of,3
are you doing some kind of science project,3

bearing in mind that bill wright the chairman of macrosystems is a close personal friend of mine which side of this mess would uyouu desire to be on andy and dont allow my very tight personal relationship with bill to influence your answer in any way,3
it is and it isnt charles macrosystems new software copies all the bestknown elements of kronos spreadsheet program if theyre allowed to sell it kronos will get undersold right out of business for me the legal principle involved is copyright infringement,3
hes upset hes sorry,3
im trying to help your partner youre not a member of his immediate family i could have you removed from the er,3
dr klenstein its not a pleasant procedure but if the ks is causing the diarrhea we ought to know right away,3
this is my partner we keep records of hospital visits nothing personal,3
sounds delightful,3
meanwhile id like to prepare you for a colonoscopy so we can take a look inside,3

it was good working with you andrew youre welcome hey shouldnt you put that thing back on,3
excellent work joe i thank you,3
a good start,3
what,3
what do you call a thousand lawyers chained together at the bottom of the ocean,3
thank you,3
yes,3
can you see the lesions on your chest in this mirror,3
if it please the court id like to ask mr beckett to remove his shirt so that the jury can have an uaccurateu idea of what were talking about,3
yes on my torso,3
do you have any lesions on uanyu part of your body at this time that resemble the lesions that were on your face at the time you were fired,3
well many things but i think the thing i love the most is that every once in a while not that often but occasionally you get to be part of justice being done its really quite a thrill when that happens,3
what do you love about it,3
i love the law i know the law i excel at practicing it its the only thing ive ever wanted to do,3
what makes you an excellent lawyer,3
im an excellent lawyer,3
are you a good lawyer,3
you dont bring your personal life into a law firm youre not supposed to uhaveu a personal life really anyway i did plan to tell charles eventually but then this thing happened at the tennis club,3
can you explain uwhyu you didnt,3
no i didnt,3
in the years you worked at wyant wheeler did you ever tell charles wheeler you were gay,3
i still am,3
except you were gay,3
i suppose you could say that,3
a regular allamerican guy,3
you didnt look then the way you look now,3
its possible i was infected with the hiv virus at that time but i wasnt diagnosed until several years later,3
obviously at this time you werent sick,3
possessed of an encyclopedic knowledge of the law a razor sharp litigator a genuine leader gifted at bringing out the very best in others an awesome ability to illuminate the most complex of legal concepts to colleagues courtrooms the person on the street the kind of person who plays three sets of tennis but doesnt sweat but underneath the elegant surface was an adventurous spirit,3
what kind of person is that,3
he was the kind of person i thought i wanted to be,3
what impressed you about him,3
particularly charles,3
youre ready dont worry,3
ill look over the q and a,3
opera,3
want to hear my favorite aria,3
opera,3
thanks do you like opera,3
i know a good probate lawyer,3
ive made provisions in my will for some charities miguel will need a lawyer i know its not your area,3
we proceed representing your estate,3
what happens,3
ive considered that,3
theres a possibility i wont be around for the end of this trial,3
for a healthy baby for lisa to make it through the delivery for the phillies to get into the playoffs,3
what have you prayed for,3
then we establish how wheelers boys recruited you after law school,3
do you pray,3
what,3
charles okay miller,3
beckett,3
uh huh,3
when you refer to wheeler call him charles to show how youd been admitted to the inner circle you were considered one of them,3
lets review these notes for your testimony we have a big day on monday,3
thank you for sharing that with me joe,3
let me tell you something okay when youre brought up like the rest of us in a place like where i was brought up theres not a whole lot of discussion about homosexuals as a kid youre taught right away that queers are weird queers are funny theyre a danger to kids theyre afraid to fight and they all want to cop your joint and that pretty much sums up the general thinking out there if you want to know the truth,3
you survived your first gay party intact,3
youre right,3
correct,3
you think im uncomfortable,3
thank you,3
no we have to do it but later allright,3
sure its fine,3
excuse me im having a goddamn party is that allright with you,3
beer we need to go over your q and a,3
what do you want,3
lets find you a drink,3
get it,3
not bad,3
im a law suit,3
i had a blood transfusion today i feel great,3
beckett you seem better energized more alive,3
its me you dork,3
were friends of becketts,3
parrtyy,3
any settlement agreement umustu include and this is critical a letter of exoneration making clear my termination had nothing to do with the quality of my work,3
one more thing your honor,3
arline,3
arline decision supreme court,3
there is no relevant precedent,3
thank you,3
so kenton connected the lesion uandu whatever suspicions he had about your personal life to this woman maria and blew the whistle on you suddenly youre losing files and its time to let you go but up to this point youve been their golden boy their rising star their behavior is inconsistent,3
no they didnt fire her,3
they didnt fire her,3
the partner who spotted the lesion walter kenton used to work for benton myers in dc theres a paralegal there maria torres shes had lesions on and off for three years she says it was common knowledge around the office that her lesions were caused by aids,3
one of the partners spotted a lesion on my forehead,3
how did they find out,3
rayisha very nice,3
rayisha,3
whats her name,3
huh oh great shes great,3
im a lawyer hows your baby,3
find a lawyer,3
what,3
whod you get,3
fine,3
oh beckett hows it goin,3
dont send flowers joe im not dead yet,3
beckett im sorry about whats happened to you its a fucking kick in the head,3
thanks for your time,3
correct i dont,3
look i know i have a case if you dont want to take it for personal reasons,3
i knew you were going to say that i dont buy it and i dont see a case,3
they sabotaged me,3
okay they want you out its against the law to fire you for having aids so they make you look like a fuck up which leads us to the mysterious lost file,3
joe from the day i arrived to the day they fired me i performed consistently thoroughly and with absolute excellence and if they hadnt fired me thats what id be doing today,3
okay okay they discover you have this horrible disgusting terminal illness and they panic for any number of perfectly valid reasons theyre frightened for themselves their families maybe its the homo angle maybe they dont want to rub elbows with someone whos just popped out of the closet with a terminal case of acne and how do they explain your status to the client for chrissake,3
the law says people with disabilities cannot be terminated so long as they can perform the duties required by their position,3
as in the vegetable,3
i buy that,3
charles i must apologize again for the kronos mishap it was a scary few minutes around here wow but thank god the complaint was found and no damage was done,3
big trouble,3
makeup,3
hell they are staring whats that shit on your face,3
i dove back into work everything was fine until the lesions started,3
continue,3
miguel alvarez weve lived together for nine years,3
your lover,3
my lover and i,3
we,3
i was diagnosed with aids eight months ago during a bout of pneumonia i recovered quickly and was back at work in ten days since i was doing so well on the azt we decided against telling anyone about it,3
continue,3
nine,3
how many lawyers did you go to before you called me,3
i misplaced an important complaint thats their story want to hear mine,3
continue,3
correct im seeking representation,3
you want to sue wyant wheeler hellerman tetlow and brown,3
i was fired by wyant wheeler i plan to bring a wrongful termination suit against charles wheeler and his partners,3
thanks beckett im real excited about it what can i do for you,3
kids are great,3
little baby girl,3
congratulations,3
one week old,3
new baby,3
uh yeah,3
its okay can i sit down,3
whoaoh sorry i,3
i have aids,3
jesus christ what happened to you,3
funny,3
client of yours,3
i know what it means your honor imagine how the children in this neighborhood have been made to feel the pounding of construction ringing in their ears as this skyscraper a tribute to mankinds greed grows daily casting an ominous shadow over their lives filling them with dread even as they are surrounded in a black toxic fog blocking out the sun while poisoning their lungs and counselor calls it harmless,3
defined by websters as harmless,3
innocuous,3
your honor i submit there were no complaints until counselor began knocking on doors drumming up business and the dust which counselor refers to has appeared on only three occasions each time it has been examined and the results,3
your honor since rockwell corp began construction the surrounding residential neighborhood has been enshrouded in a cloud of foulsmelling germcarrying pestilent dust my client is being forced to breathe known carcinogens daily other residents are coming forth on a daily basis to add their voices of outrage,3
get down to word processing help jamey look,3
what can i do,3
fucking word processing lost my kronos complaint which must be filed by fucking five oclock if its late theres no case every problem has a solution,3
i thought i was supposed to be covering for you god andy you look awful,3
catch me later ill be here and tell amy i love her painting its on my wall,3
im late i have to pick up amy from her afterschool but i want to talk to you about that hansen thing,3
rach,3
thank you,3
no i cant really see it,3
answer the question please,3
by the time i was fired there were four lesions on my face much bigger,3
one here in front of my ear,3
do you have any lesions on your face at this time,3
absolutely,3
and its your contention that when the partners were made aware of the lesions they jumped to the conclusion you had aids and fired you,3
thats right,3
youve testified the lesions on your face were visible to the people you worked with correct,3
yes,3
really,3
miguel has not been infected as i said we werent aware of aids then or how it is spread,3
you could have infected him isnt that right,3
yes,3
isnt it true you have spent your life pretending to be something youre not so much so that the art of concealment and dishonesty has become second nature to you,3
in some situations,3
as a homosexual one is often forced to conceal ones sexuality is that right,3
some do i didnt,3
do other lawyers at the firm keep pictures of their spouses or fiances on their desks,3
no,3
did you keep a picture of your lover on your desk,3
that is unotu correct i never lied about it,3
while you were employed at wyant wheeler you did everything you could to make sure no one knew you were an active homosexual correct,3
no,3
do you need a break,3
id heard of usomethingu the gay plague gay cancer but we didnt know how you could get it or that it could kill you,3
youd uheardu of aids in 1984 85,3
its impossible to know exactly when or how i was infected with hiv,3
were you aware in 1984 or 1985 that there was a fatal disease out there called aids and that you could contract it through sexual activity,3
i guess it was 1984 85,3
when approximately what year did this event take place,3
yes,3
yes,3
gay upornographicu movies,3
gay movies,3
what kind of movies do they show there,3
have you ever been to the apollo cinema on sansom street,3
not unnecessary ones,3
in general do you take risks in other areas of your life,3
in my work yes calculated risks you have to,3
do you take risks,3
something like that,3
you said earlier you aspired to be the kind of person who had an adventurous spirit is that correct,3
thanks mom dad,3
all i know is you got through your diagnosis fine like a trooper but when they fired you you were so devastated andy i dont expect any of my kids to sit in the back of the bus fight for your rights,3
mom,3
hes out in his shed showing your uncle his new riding mower,3
wheres dad,3
ancient how do you think i feel put that thing down and give me a hug andrew stop he still doesnt listen,3
hi mom how do you feel on your fortieth anniversary,3
are you on one of those conference calls i hate when you put me on hold,3
gillman says im fine my blood work is excellent tcells are up just a sec yes i think that would alleviate most of our concerns my platelets look good too,3
hold on mom theres no way my client will go along with that,3
whats dr gillman say,3
im fine,3
andy this is a nice surprise how are you hon,3
hi mom its me,3
hello,3
thank you,3
yes im now in charge of the paralegal department,3
were you recently promoted,3
yes,3
miss burton do you still work at wyant wheeler,3
objection,3
he was losing weight he looked kind of tired sometimes but he was working so hard still i felt something was wrong and i cant believe utheyreu saying they didnt notice anything,3
thank you no more questions,3
i said my earrings uareu american theyre africanamerican,3
what did you say,3
apparently mr wheeler felt they were too ethnic is the word she used she said he would like it if i wore something smaller less garish and more american,3
your earrings,3
well one time mr wheelers secretary lydia told me mr wheeler had a problem with my earrings,3
in what way,3
yes,3
no have you ever felt discriminated against at wyant wheeler,3
is that a question,3
ms burton youre black,3
your honor if mr beckett was forced by his illness to use a wheelchair would the defense ask him to park it outside were talking about aids were talking about lesions lets useeu what were talking about,3
we object your honor it would unfairly influence the jury,3
ill withdraw it mr beckett were you living with miguel alvarez in 1984 or 1985 when you had your anonymous sexual encounter in the porn theater,3
objection,3
ill withdraw you were aware when you worked with maria torres that she had aids correct,3
objection,3
ill rephrase did you have anything to do with this file being misplaced,3
objection,3
fact andrew beckett performed at a consistently mediocre level fact he made a grievous error on a multimillion dollar lawsuit fact he claims he is the victim of lies and deceit fact andrew beckett lied to his employers going to great efforts to conceal his disease from them fact he was successful in his duplicity the partners at wyant wheeler did unotu know andrew beckett had aids when they fired him,3
and when lawyers break the law when this society loses respect for the law when that day comes our cherished institutions will be burned to the ground and our children and grandchildren will live like savages,3
uh no not really,3
get real,3
a homosexual encounter,3
thanks doc but i dont need an aids test are you crazy but thanks for the information really,3
not by touching or shaking hands or hugging using the same toilet even kissing someone with aids is safe but it theres something in your past youre worried about,3
it doesnt travel through the air by breathing or touching right,3
right,3
the guy sat in my office you cant get aids that way right,3
you want to give me an aids utestu,3
joe i dont care a whit about your private life,3
why are we going to do that,3
were going to draw blood,3
yeah but doc isnt it true they keep finding out new things about this disease so you tell me today theres no danger and i go home and i hold my baby and six months from now i hear on the news whoops we were wrong you ucanu carry it on your clothes your skin and now ive got to worry about my kid what are you doing,3
leave that,3
right,3
the hiv virus can only be transmitted through the exchange of bodily fluids namely blood and semen,3
im not worried what are you doing,3
you had contact with someone who has aids and youre worried,3
since that time ive devoted more thought to the subject and thats how i feel now,3
five months ago you characterized andrew beckett as caviar and now youre calling him a cheeseburger your standards have shifted a great deal and id like to know why youve changed your mind,3
i might,3
its a long way between being overwhelmed and being satisfied a cheeseburger may be satisfying whereas caviar and champagne and roast duck and baked alaska for dessert might be considered overwhelming do you agree,3
it satisfied me,3
did that thrill impress and overwhelm you,3
we won,3
okay mr laird explain this to me like im a four year old did andrew beckett win your lawsuit for you or not,3
i may have said something like that but thats not how i feel at this moment,3
according to the deposition you said you were thrilled impressed overwhelmed by the quality of andrew becketts work do you remember saying that,3
thats correct,3
mr laird when i approached you about being a witness at this trial and you agreed you gave sworn testimony in a deposition is that correct,3
we were satisfied,3
were you pleased with his work,3
thats correct,3
but andrew beckett was in charge of litigation for the suit,3
wyant wheeler represented us,3
andrew beckett represented your company in a lawsuit in 1990 is that correct,3
people who want to bend the rules,3
what kind of people,3
sometimes it seems like society is urunu by these kinds of people,3
yes character to the extent that it affects a persons ability to do a great job,3
explain to me if you can mr wheeler explain this to me like im a ten yearold this trial is not about a disease is that what youre saying unotu about your understandable if unfounded fear of catching aids through casual contact with someone who has it youre saying this trial is about andrew becketts character am i getting this right,3
weve got a committee meeting,3
but hes got lots of other peoples lives to ruin,3
and i hate to rush you out of here but,3
we dont think its fair to keep you here where your future is limited but we wish you luck andy all the luck in the world,3
in a word yes,3
lets put it this way andy your place in the future of this firm is no longer secure,3
youre in trouble,3
andy before we begin id just like to say everyone in this room is your friend,3
get a life,3
youre the asshole buddy,3
fuck you you want to kick my ass you want to try asshole,3
dont you know this is exactly the kind of bullshit that makes people hate you guys,3
take it as a compliment geesh,3
relax i ought to kick your faggoty little ass for you,3
do i look gay to you relax,3
whats the matter with you do i look gay to you,3
arent you,3
whoa whoa whoa whoa do you think you think uimu gay,3
would you like to have a drink with me i just finished a game i could use a beer i dont pick up people in drug stores every day,3
great,3
second,3
good school what year,3
night honey,3
ill see you in an hour max,3
my lettuce is wilting,3
did i ever tell you i hate costume parties,3
great lisa thank you,3
lisa cmon one guy sticking his dick in another guys mouth its disgusting,3
two men making love now tell me again uwhyu is that disgusting,3
yeah,3
joe,3
very funny i had a box of pampers under my arm for chrissake,3
have you changed your aftershave,3
is there some kind of expression ive picked up from beckett some kind of fairy attitude ive unconsciously adopted am i walking different some kind of vocal thing have i picked up some kind of homo uvibeu,3
dont know joe,3
would you take a client if you were constantly thinking i hope this guy doesnt touch me i dont even want him to ubreatheu on me,3
thats perfectly clear,3
and the way they work out pumping up so they can be macho and faggot at the same time i cant ustandu that shit now im being totally honest with you,3
fine joe,3
i mean two guys doing the horizontal thing i dont get it dont they get confused is that mine i thought it was yours hey call me old fashioned call me conservative i think maybe you have to be a man to get just how nauseating the whole basic idea really is,3
okay joe,3
allright i admit it im prejudiced i dont want to work with a homosexual you got me,3
probably since she was born,3
since when,3
duh,3
your aunt teresa is gay that beautiful sensuous woman is a ulesbianu,3
karen berman aunt teresa my cousin tommy who lives in rochester eddie meyers from the office joe cantwell hes one of the partners his lover greg stanley the guy whos putting in our kitchen cabinets,3
who,3
lots,3
how many do you know,3
how many gays do you know,3
not especially,3
you have a problem with gays joe,3
give me the camera joe,3
you load the film no on this side or this side dont move the baby,3
tell iris all about it take good care of mrs finley iris beckett come in,3
now that you mention it,3
of course you have a case now i want you to go with my assistant iris and fill out some forms shell tell you about our fee arrangement mrs finley any back pain since the accident dizziness nightmares,3
yeah do i have a case,3
why should i,3
why didnt you cross at the crosswalk,3
right,3
i felt and still feel nothing but the deepest sympathy and compassion for people like maria who have contracted this terrible disease through no fault of their own,3
but didnt you avoid contact with ms torres after you found out she had aids she says you acted repulsed by her and you avoided her is that correct,3
i uknowu the difference that doesnt mean im always able to recognize the difference,3
so you are aware of the difference between a lesion and a bruise is that correct,3
usheu didnt try to conceal it,3
like firing andrew beckett taught uhimu a lesson,3
yes we did,3
you taught him a lesson,3
we stuck his head in the latrine after ten of us had used it,3
how did you do that,3
yeah but we took care of him,3
like two sailors playing hide the salami,3
going on like,3
so during those long voyages months at a time out to sea no women in sight a hundred hardworking robust young men in the prime of their life at the peak of their natural appetites desires their god given hormonal uinstinctsu anything going on,3
not when i was in the navy,3
any women on board,3
anywhere from two weeks to several months,3
a trial takes utimeu beckett do you know what im saying,3
whoa whoa what do you expect them to say youre alan dershowitz,3
beckett,3
your honor may i have ten minutes in redirect,3
this would be a good time to break for the day,3
you had one guy like that,3
lets continue,3
no we dont however as regards this witness im going to sustain the defenses objection,3
with all due respect your honor we dont live in this courtroom do we,3
in this courtroom mr miller justice is blind to matters of race creed color religion and sexual orientation,3
very good joe now belinda ive got a figure over here of one million five i,3
based on what my client would have earned over the next three years including benefits and projected raises and the extraordinary cost of medical care for someone with acquired immune deficiency syndrome we would settle today for the very fair amount of one million five hundred thousand dollars,3
hold it joe he wants to come back to work chuck,3
reinstatement at full salary back pay covering the period of unemployment and,3
by god you uwillu settle it if you force this case to trial young man youll regret it for the rest of your naturalborn days now joseph what would you require to settle this matter today,3
if it please your honor we uhopeu to settle this matter,3
on behalf of the defendants,3
ill take that under consideration your honor,3
ive seen your television commercials if you or anyone you know has been injured through the fault of others it should say through the unegligenceu of others,3
joseph miller your honor macready and shilts legal services,3
attorney for the plaintiff,3
you have to make a decision is this guy partner material,3
to suit their personal desires and the rest of us have to live with it,3
andy you dont want this,3
youll be sorry beckett,3
holy shit did you bob,3
wait a minute the man was fired for incompetence not because he has aids you didnt know he was sick did you bob,3
we ought to be suing him,3
andrew brought aids into our offices into our mens room he brought aids to our annual goddamn family picnic,3
dr j,3
julius,3
helloooo,3
andy it seems that something has come over you lately a kind of stupor a fogginess a lack of focus earth to andy anybody home,3
kings are out of fashion id rather be thought of as a benevolent tyrant its an antitrust action,3
its good to be king hey charles,3
its time to get this society back on track,3
but we shouldnt have fired him,3
but now were standing up for ourselves,3
i didnt tell the others i was afraid to,3
if you feel differently bob you should say so when youre called to the stand after all this isnt a conspiracy,3
charles,3
very interesting bob lets make a note of that andy didnt lose the complaint in his computer he never put it in he lied about that too,3
no matter how hard i try i cant lose a file in my computer,3
keep them from that area on grounds of relevancy what bob,3
ive discovered something interesting charles,3

nobodys gonna turn a murderer loose i fuckin knew better,3

well guess if it was trickeration hed just do me huh then againi am worth twice as much alive didnt know johns aint a cop oh hes got that shiny badge an all but nah hes just a merc and im just a payday thats why he wont kill me the creed is greed,3
why whatd you hear,3
you scare me riddick thats what you wanna hear isnt it there i admit it can i get back to work now,3
i asked what uyouu thought,3
entered our minds,3
an now youre worried about a repeat of history,3
i got the quickandugly version,3
strange not doin a runup on the main drive yet strange unless he told you the particulars of my escape,3
theyre coming,3
power cells,3
look deeper,3
then where is he hes not in the hole we looked,3
fairly fuckin ironic wouldnt you say slamlights so dim that you go and get your eyeballs taken out and shined up then you wind up here three asskick suns maybe i did do a few people but not this one no maam not this time,3
heard about it just never seen it,3
slam doctor well we called him doctor,3
you did this to yourself,3
show me your eyes,3
all you people are so scared of me an most days id take that as a compliment but it aint me you gotta worry about now,3
the ones tellin me to go for the sweet spot just to the left of the spine fourth lumbar down the abdominal aorta what a gusher had a cup on his belt so i used it to catch a little runoff metallic taste to it human blood coppery but if you cut it with peppermint schnapps that goes away course thats more for winter summertime i take mine straight,3
what whispers,3
mean the whispers,3
tell me about the sounds you told them you heard something right before if you dont talk to me johnsll take another crack at it at your skull,3
i think i twisted my ankle running backwards like that and im not sure i can okay thats a lie i just dont want to be alone back there anymore if you could just give me a few minutes up front here,3
what switch what,3
can we switch,3
lets move just a detour hell get us there,3
well have to carry the cellsdrag themwhatever it takes,3
i hate to kill a beautiful theory with an ugly fact but that sandcat wont run at night,3
awright so maybe well have enough light,3
possibly,3
those umbrellas the ones that mist would they burn if you got a receipt,3
not sure ten,3
how many bottles,3
spirits anything over 45 proof burns well,3
one cutting torchone handlight here two more in the cabini uthinku two more,3
it hurts them light actually hurts them,3
like the light is scalding it,3
there,3
i know whats in here,3
christ you dont know whats out there,3
cargo hold everyone in the cargo hold lesgo lesgo lesgo,3
just a suggestion but perhaps we should flee,3
its starting,3
what do my eyes see,3
200yearold singlemalt scotch is to booze as foie gras is to duck guts,3
this is it booze uthatsu what you have to drink,3
how much you weigh right now fry huh,3
we cannot go through there,3
would you rag your stupid hole,3
tried to kill us in our sleep paris had it right we uareu disposable were just walking ghosts to her,3
just shut up okay,3
she tried to blow the whole fucking passenger cabin tried to kill us,3
this does not help us johns,3
no no youre right fry whats to be afraid of my life is a steamin pile of meaningless toadshit anyhow so i say mush on canyons only couple hundred meters after that were in skiff city so why dont you just butch up stuff a cork in that kid and get,3
are you fucking high again just listen to,3
i dunno nice breeze wide open spaces you know im startin to enjoy myself out here,3
i was wrong i admit it my bad okay now lets just go back to the ship,3
hey uyoureu the one who got me out here turned me into a goddamn sled dog an now you spect me to go back like a uwhippedu dog,3
stay in the light everybody stay in the fucking,3
we arent completely stupid,3
riddick uriddicku,3
so you noticed too,3
i dont get it johns what is so goddamn valuable in your life that youre worried about losing huh is there anything at all besides your next hype got no right to be so scared neither one of us,3
you give him the cells and the ship and he will leave you he will leave you all out there to die,3
were just burnin light here,3
hell lead you over the first cliff you know that dont you,3
because youre 79 kilos of gutless white meat and uthatsu why you cant come up with a better plan,3
79 kilos,3
how much,3
what the hells it matter,3
how much you weigh johns,3
hey why dont you rag your hole for two seconds and let someone else come up with a plan that doesnt involve mass suicide,3
for your own fear,3
smoke screen for what,3
oh dont use her like that for a smoke screen,3
look we gotta think about everyone now the kid especially how scared is she gonna be out there,3
we can stick to the plan if we get four cells back to the skiff were off this rock,3
oh lady if youre in your right mind i pray you go insane,3
sokay sokay i killed it,3
stop it stop it stop it,3
you coulda helped and you didnt,3
my first runin with riddick went for the sweetspot and missed they had to leave a piece of the shiv in there i can feel it sometimes pressing against the cord so maybe the care and feeding of my nerveendings is my business,3
anything uelseu we should know about you johns christ here i am lettin you play games with our lives when,3
owens was already dead his brain just hadnt caught on to that fact,3
uyouu made it a problem when you let owens die like that when you had enough drugs to knock out a fucking muleteam,3
not a problem unless youre gonna make,3
and here you got two mornings every day wow were you ubornu lucky,3
you have a little caffeine in the morning i have a little morphine so what,3
never said you were a hype either,3
i never said i was,3
youre not a real cop are you just some mercenary who goes around talkin about the law like,3
i wont give him a chance to grab another ship or to slash another pilots throat,3
dancin on razor blades here,3
hes a murderer the law says hes gotta do his bid,3
you know he hasnt harmed any of us far as i can tell he hasnt even lied to us just stick to the deal johns let him go if thats what it,3
we need a failsafe bring the cells over at the last possible minute when the wings are ready when we uknowu were ready to launch,3
you mean if he learns that youre gonna royally fuck him over,3
mayve noticed chains dont work on this guy only way were truly safe is if he believes hes goin free but if he ustopsu believin,3
oh this is a dangerous game youre playing johns,3
thats what i said,3
you said we were going to trust him now you said there was a deal,3
he also figured out how to kill the pilot fry,3
okay maybe thats a ugoodu thing maybe i can use him to help with,3
hijacked a prison transport made a helluva good run fore i tracked him down,3
he can pilot,3
uget the fucking cells over hereu johns whats the discussion,3
were not sure uwhenu it happens so lets not,3
wait for what until its so dark we cant even find our way back to,3
lets wait on the power cells,3
need those cells from the crash ship shit still gotta check out the hull patch the wings,3
wha,3
60 years ago,3
lets board this up and get the hell gone they seem to stick to the dark so if we stick to daylight should be all,3
so what happened where are they then,3
rag it riddick nobody wants your theories on,3
25 kilos each huh,3
15 6gigs here90 gigs totalother ship carries 20gig cells sofive five total to launch,3
how many,3
okay that should buy us a syscheck but well need more cells,3
nothing we cant repair so long as the electrical adapts,3
little rattyass,3
thanks for the tip johns,3
you said it not me lets just not let one bad call lead to another,3
what you think im doin this to prove something,3
hey bein ballsy with your life now doesnt change what came before its just stupid,3
nobody else is going down but me okay,3
i dont but that ground looked none too stable and i dont want anyone,3
thought you didnt believe his story,3
well dont ask me to,3
uwere gonna find the bodyu johns christ youre a cop why am i tellin you this we gotta go down and find it,3
i uamu sure look murders aside riddick belongs in the asshole hall of fame he loves the jawjackin loves making you afraid cuz thats all he has and youre playing right into,3
lets just be sure,3
i uknowu what happened he went off on the guy buried him on the hill somewhere and now hes trying to,3
i assume he licked it clean,3
so why isnt it all bloody,3
sir shivalot he likes to cut,3
he used that,3
ease up ease up johns just tell me what,3
i dont play thati dont play that so just try again cmon riddick tell me a better lie,3
like my pistola,3
like what,3
sorry thought i heard something,3
shut up,3
no juice looks like its been laid up for years but we might be able to adapt,3
thought he might be coolin it in the boneyard could either doubleback to the ship or slip in behind us so i left the bottle out as bait,3
what,3
didnt bite,3
fuck guess im more glad to be here than i thought,3
so now you know,3
during the landingwhen things were at their worstowens was at his best hes the one who wouldnt let the pilot dump the passenger cabin,3
you see anybody else here just between you and me,3
promise me swear to me you wont,3
hey you can tell me carolyn,3
whatd owens mean bout not touching the switch,3
better keep moving,3
so i noticed never seen a captain quite so ready to leave her ship,3
no no i wanted to get away,3
probably right,3
probably makes it worse dehydrates you even more,3
tell me its not a mirage,3
what,3
which means he went toward sunrise,3
thought you found his restraints over there toward sunset,3
a very good sign thats riddicks direction you do unotu wanna be caught in the dark with this guy,3
little swampflu from the conga system never shook it with all this cryosleep,3
smatter,3
only around humans,3
i dont need his life story is he really that dangerous,3
be my choice already escaped once from the maxslam facility on,3
we just keep him locked up forever,3
big evil,3
and him,3
carolyn fry id shake hands but,3
amazing im johns,3
hey me over here,3
hey who,3
hey,3
johns is leaving you a gun just do me a favor huh get my crewies buried they were good guys who died bad,3
what youre goin off too,3
imam we should leave soon before nightfall but while its cooler,3
ask if anyone has anything in cargo anything to drink,3
well is it just the pump,3
somethin knocked us offlane maybe a rogue comet maybe well never know,3
so what the bloody hell happened anyways,3
its the atmosphere too much pressure not enough oxygen might take a few days to,3
70 seconds you still got 70 seconds to level this beast out,3
owens,3
and there wasnt a simulated cockroach alive within 50 clicks of the simulated crash site uthatsu how they train you on a fucking simulator,3
when captain went down you stepped up whether you like it or not now they train you for this so,3
companys not here is it,3
look fry company says were responsible for every one of those,3
so what we should both go down too out of sheer fucking nobility,3
you mean that load of passengers,3
cant get my nose downtoo much load back there,3
fry,3
just tell me were still in the shipping lane just show me all those stars all those bright beautiful deepspace,3
1550 millibars dropping 20 mb per minute shit were hemorrhaging air usomethinu took a swipe at us,3
oh no not owens not wai wai wait uim owensu right,3
you hear me captains dead owens too,3
i mean i mean chrono shows were 22 weeks out so gravity wasnt supposed to kick in for another 19 i mean i mean i mean why did i fall uat allu,3
hes dead capns dead christ i was looking right at him when,3
why did i fall on you,3
rain,3
oh no no no no,3
and what about the cells,3
the sled as a shield,3
do what i say please,3
i would rather we all stay,3
dont stop just slow down little more space tween us and them,3
what,3
imam slow down,3
no im not but uheu can,3
and youre certain you can find the way back even in the dark,3
theyre afraid of our light that means we dont have to be so afraid of them,3
riddick,3
hasan,3
quiet please everyone,3
i saw the cutmarks on the bones wasnt a natural dieoff,3
for now,3
one is all,3
were all on the same hajj now,3
frightening thought,3
chrislam teaches that once in every lifetime should there be a great hajj a great pilgrimage to know god better yes but to know yourself as well,3
you were on a pilgrimage to new mecca,3
some prophet guy and a city man but he had to travel to the desert where there was quiet to hear the words of god,3
some prophet guy,3
you know who muhammad was,3
so quiet you get used to the sounds of the ship then,3
one of the christian habits we udidntu adopt perhaps unfortunately well have to wait,3
i dont suppose,3
its more a place where souls are found mr riddick,3
think a soul could get lost there with all those pilgrimtypes,3
new mecca,3
keep going or i will,3
suleiman,3
get the girl back under keep going,3
suleiman,3
give my blessing to the girl she needs a spare,3
he will be with us nonetheless,3
cuz you dont spend half your life in lockdown with a horsebit in your mouth and not believe and you surely dont start out in a liquor store trash bin with an umbilical cord wrapped around your neck and not believe oh absolutely i believe in god and i absolutely hate the fucker,3
you udontu see,3
i see well even if you dont believe in god it doesnt mean he wont be,3
and pointless,3
blessing you like the others its painless,3
whatre you doin,3
you mean,3
which half,3
wheres mr johns,3
there is no safe,3
wellwe must keep her close then here shell be safe if we put her between,3
has anyone checked the coring room,3
has anyone seen the young one ali,3
listen to her uheru when she was willing to sacrifice us all,3
shes the captain we should listen to,3
hes running us round in circles look for yourself look,3
we crossed our own tracks,3
pleasethis solves nothingplease,3
oh trash baby youre gonna regret this,3
those suns gotta come back usometimeu and if these animals really are phobic about light we just sit tight till then,3
i had the impressionfrom the model that the two planets were moving as one that there would bea lasting darkness,3
the child heard you before any of us could even,3
we got youits okay its okaywe got you now,3
im bornagain,3
god is great yes,3
all deserts have water somewhere god shall lead us there,3
for what there is no water you understand that dont you,3
oh so im disposable,3
shes the pilot she should stay close to the cells,3
not staying in here another,3
very big beads,3
like an emergency liferaft right,3
well just a skiff disposable really,3
didnt say that but least this way i dont have to worry about falling asleep and not wakin up,3
so just like that wave your little wand and hes one of us now,3
maratha crowbill warpicks from northern india very rare,3
